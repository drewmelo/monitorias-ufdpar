To reduce carbon emissions, carbon pricing is a commonly used policy instrument. While the implementation of carbon pricing may widen income inequality. However, it is unclear how to narrow income inequality in the process of urban agglomeration's low-carbon development. To answer this question, we evaluate the impacts of integrated carbon pricing policy with/without various revenue recycling (RR) schemes on the economy and income inequality of Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration using a city-level multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Our findings indicate that carbon pricing without RR schemes damages the gross domestic product (GDP), welfare, and household income, especially in cities located in Hebei Province. Nevertheless, it reduces carbon emissions, notably in Tangshan and Handan. With RR, not only do GDP and welfare losses diminish, but income inequality also decreases when revenues are recycled to rural, particularly rural low-income households in Hebei. These results provide valuable insights for designing a proper revenue recycling scheme to promote income equality. Furthermore, since no single RR scheme can simultaneously maximize both GDP and welfare, it is crucial to balance economic development with welfare improvement when choosing revenue recycling schemes to complement carbon pricing. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon pricing; CGE model; Income inequality; Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration","China; Jingjinji; Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration; Low emission; Carbon emissions; Carbon pricing; Computable general equilibrium modeling; Global climate changes; Gross domestic products; Income inequality; Jing-jin-ji urban agglomeration; Low-carbon development; Policy instruments; Urban agglomerations; agglomeration; carbon emission; economic development; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; income distribution; pricing policy; recycling; study perspective; Carbon capture and utilization","","","","","Tianjin University, TJU, (2024XQIM-0003); Tianjin University, TJU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72304224, 71834004, 72225013, 71904141, 72004159); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (21YJC630014); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M692568); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","Funding text 1: The authors grant the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 72225013, 71834004, and 72304224), Ministry of Education in China (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Science (grant number 21YJC630014), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant number 2021M692568), and Tianjin University Research Fund Program of Science and Technology Innovation Outstanding Youth (grant number 2024XQIM-0003).

This paper sheds light on the impact of climate change and institutional quality on income inequality for a panel data set of 35 Asian countries and territories over the period of 1990–2021. Results from estimations of Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) and two-step System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) demonstrate that the climate change–proxied by temperature and precipitation–exacerbates income inequality, while improvement in institutional quality not only reduces it, but also lessens the harmful impact of climate change on income equality. Findings are robust with various proxies of income inequality. These results strongly confirm the important role of institutional reform in the context of rising climate change and high level of income inequality in Asian countries. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Asian countries; climate change; income inequality; institutional quality","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J., Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth, Handbook of Economic Growth, 1, pp. 385-472, (2005); Afesorgbor S.K., Mahadevan R., The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Income Inequality of Target States, World Development, 83, pp. 1-11, (2016); Akram N., Is Climate Change Hindering Economic Growth of Asian Economies?, Asia-Pacific Development Journal, 19, 2, pp. 1-18, (2012); Alagidede P., Adu G., Frimpong P.B., The Effect of Climate Change on Economic Growth: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, 18, 3, pp. 417-436, (2016); Alam M.M., Taufique K.M.R., Sayal A., Do Climate Changes Lead to Income Inequality?

Climate change and environmental degradation are risks to society subject to macroeconomic instability. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the connection between macroeconomic volatility and ecological degradation, but the impact of inequality in emissions and income on macroeconomic instability remains untouched, especially in emerging economies. This study utilizes a balanced panel data of 22 emerging economies from 1996 to 2019 to unveil the effect of carbon and income inequality on macroeconomic instability. As control variables, we incorporate government expenditure, bank credit, and governance into the macroeconomic instability function. The outcomes of the baseline PMG-ARDL model imply that both carbon inequality and income inequality instigate macroeconomic instability. However, income inequality impedes macroeconomic stability more than carbon inequality. In addition, the results demonstrate that government expenditure reduces macroeconomic instability, whereas bank credit intensifies it. The results of FGLS estimation are also robust to the baseline model. These findings encourage policymakers in emerging economies to use various fiscal instruments to improve economic and environmental resilience and reduce carbon emissions and income inequality. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Autoregressive distributed lag; Carbon disparity; Economic inequality; Feasible generalized least squares; Macroeconomic volatility","","","","","","","","Abbas H.S.M., Xu X., Sun C., Role of foreign direct investment interaction to energy consumption and institutional governance in sustainable GHG emission reduction, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 40, pp. 56808-56821, (2021); Abbas H.S.M., Xu X., Sun C., Ullah A., Nabi G., Gillani S., Raza M.A.A., Sustainable use of energy resources, regulatory quality, and foreign direct investment in controlling GHGs emissions among selected Asian economies, Sustainability, 13, 3, (2021); Abbasi S., Choukolaei H.A., A systematic review of green supply chain network design literature focusing on carbon policy, Decision Analytics Journal, 6, (2023); Abbasi S., Erdebilli B., Green closed-loop supply chain networks’ response to various carbon policies during COVID-19, Sustainability, 15, 4, (2023); Abbasi S., Daneshmand-Mehr M., Ghane Kanafi A., Green closed-loop supply chain network design during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: A case study in the Iranian automotive industry, Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 28, 1, pp. 69-103, (2023); Abbasi S., Moosivand M., Vlachos I., Talooni M., Designing the location–routing problem for a cold supply chain considering the COVID-19 disaster, Sustainability, 15, 21, (2023); Abbasi S., Vlachos I., Rekabi S., Talooni M., Designing the distribution network of essential items in the critical conditions of earthquakes and COVID-19 simultaneously, Sustainability, 15, 22, (2023); Abdouli M., Hammami S., Investigating the causality links between environmental quality, foreign direct investment and economic growth in MENA countries, International Business Review, 26, 2, pp. 264-278, (2017); Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J.A., Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth, Handbook of Economic Growth, 1, pp. 385-472, (2005); Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J., Thaicharoen Y., Institutional causes, macroeconomic symptoms: Volatility, crises and growth, Journal of Monetary Economics, 50, 1, pp. 49-123, (2003); Ahiadorme J.W., Monetary policy in search of macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth, Research in Economics, 76, 4, pp. 308-324, (2022); Ahmed A.D., Suardi S., Macroeconomic volatility, trade and financial liberalization in Africa, World Development, 37, 10, pp. 1623-1636, (2009); Aiyar S., Ebeke C., Inequality of opportunity, inequality of income and economic growth, World Development, 136, (2020); Alesina A., Rodrik D., Distributive politics and economic growth, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 109, 2, pp. 465-490, (1994); Arcand J.L., Berkes E., Panizza U., Too much finance?, Journal of Economic Growth, 20, 2, pp. 105-148, (2015); Avom D., Kamguia B., Ngameni J.P., Njangang H., How does terms of trade volatility affect macroeconomic volatility?

Building upon these approaches, we develop a formal model that reproduces key interactions between the economy, the financial sector, the ecosystem and the society. We test and assess the effects of several fiscal policies. We find that, in principle, mission-oriented innovation policies are the most effective option in supporting innovation and growth, while reducing income inequality. However, lacking a ‘green’ and progressive taxation system, they are unlikely to reverse the current trend in atmospheric temperature. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; mission-oriented policy; rebound effect; stock-flow consistent modelling; Supermultiplier","","","","","","","","Allain O., Tackling the Instability of Growth: A Kaleckian-Harrodian Model with an Autonomous Expenditure Component, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 39, 5, pp. 1351-1371, (2015); Allain O., A Supermultiplier Model with two non-Capacity-Generating Semi-Autonomous Demand Components, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 63, C, pp. 91-103, (2022); Berg M., Hartley B., Richters O., A Stock-Flow Consistent Input–Output Model with Applications to Energy Price Shocks, Interest Rates, and Heat Emissions, New Journal of Physics, 17, 1, pp. 1-21, (2015); Block F., Keller M.R., Where do Innovations Come from?

It also discusses recent advancements, challenges, and future opportunities for growth and development. Chile’s GDP in 2023 was nearly US$ 330 billion, with a per capita figure of over US$ 30,000 in PPP terms. The country’s economy is highly integrated into international trade, with exports and imports comprising 75% of GDP. Chile exhibits high social indicators such as life expectancy (81.4 years) and literacy rate (96.4%), but income inequality remains a significant issue, as reflected by a Gini coefficient of 0.46. Since the military coup in 1973, Chile has undergone extensive economic reforms, including trade liberalization, privatization, and the establishment of a market economy. These reforms have significantly shaped the current economic landscape. Post-1990 democratic governments focused on “growth with equity,” maintaining market-oriented policies while increasing social spending to address high poverty rates and improve social equity. The autonomous Central Bank of Chile has been instrumental in achieving and maintaining low and stable inflation rates, which is crucial for economic stability and growth. Chile’s abundant natural resources, particularly in lithium and renewable energy, present significant opportunities for economic growth, especially in the context of global efforts to combat climate change. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Chile; Economic sectors; Economy; Macroeconomic indicators; Policy reforms; Social indicators","","","","","","","","(2024); Informe Sobre La educación Superior En Chile: 1980–2003, (2002); CMF Presenta radiografía De La Actividad Bancaria a Nivel Regional., (2022); Chile Y Sus Regiones En Datos económicos.

Inequitable access to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies can exacerbate existing social vulnerabilities and enhance disparities in the impacts of climate change. Despite advances in the development of sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies, the extent to which access to practical initiatives is equitable across the population remains poorly understood. This study provides a systematic review of empirical studies that consider social equality in access to climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Our findings show that in the last decade, research has tended to focus on international income inequalities and climate injustice while few studies have considered inequalities in access to mitigation and adaptation initiatives at the neighbourhood or city level. Also largely absent from the reviewed research, were studies focused on vulnerabilities other than economic disadvantage, such as immigrant status, language barriers or physical disabilities. We suggest that more studies using mixed-methods are required to co-develop sustainable climate change adaptation practices that are accessible for all individuals and appropriate within local contexts. © 2025 The Authors","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Inequality; Social vulnerability; Urban","climate change; empirical analysis; neighborhood; social impact; sustainable development; urban climate; vulnerability; adaptation; carbon footprint; climate change; climate change mitigation; communication barrier; financial management; greenhouse gas emission; human; immigrant; income inequality; justice; land use; neighborhood; physical disability; racial disparity; Review; social equity; social inequality; social justice; social status; social vulnerability; systematic review","","","","","","","Akter S., Bagchi K., Is off-grid residential solar power inclusive?

It has been well understood that economic growth has a significant impact on carbon footprint, but it remains unclear whether this impact will be mitigated or intensified by reducing income inequality. By applying the Multi-Regional Input-Output model, this study assesses the consumption-based carbon footprints of 43 major economies over the period 1995–2019 and conducts the corresponding empirical analysis. Through examining the moderating effect of income inequality (Gini coefficient) on the relationship between economic growth (GDP per capita) and consumption-based carbon footprint (CO2 per capita), we demonstrate that a lower Gini coefficient – a more equitable distribution of income − could significantly promote the decoupling of economic growth from carbon footprint. The results also show a heterogeneous moderating effect of income inequality – reducing income inequality in rich countries helps decouple economic growth from carbon footprint more than in poor countries. This study contributes to a better understanding of the synergy among economic growth (SDG 8), income inequality reduction (SDG 10), and carbon mitigation (SDG 13). Given that reducing income inequality in the context of economic growth can have significant benefits for carbon mitigation, we would suggest that income inequality reduction should be incorporated into climate action, particularly in rich countries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon footprint; Decoupling; Economic growth; Income inequality","carbon footprint; economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; input-output analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; wage gap","","","","","Chinese Universities Scientific Fund, (2023TC020); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (23GJB00438)","This work was supported by National Social Science Foundation of China (23GJB00438) and Chinese Universities Scientific Fund ( 2023TC020 ).

While many studies explore key aspects of this dilemma, few direct attention to the pathways from climate change through socioeconomic development to the future of poverty. We build on projections of global temperature change (representative concentration pathways) and country-specific economic development (economic growth and income distribution across the shared socioeconomic pathways) to model how climate change may affect future poverty with the International Futures (IFs) model, projecting poverty across income thresholds for 175 countries through 2070. Central tendency scenarios with climate effects compared with scenarios that do not model climate change show that climate change-attributable extreme poverty will grow to 25 million people by 2030 (range: 18 to 30), 40 million by 2050 (range: 9 to 78), and 32 million by 2070 (range: 4 to 130) though overall levels of global poverty decline. If climatic tipping points are passed, the climate-attributable extreme poverty grows to 57 million people by 2030 (range: 40–72), 78 million by 2050 (range: 18–193), and 56 million by 2070 (range: 7–306). To mitigate baseline effects of climate change on extreme poverty, an improvement of global income inequality of 10% is required (range: 5–15%). © 2023, The Author(s).","Climate change; Poverty; SDG1; Socioeconomic development; Sustainable development","Climate models; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Economic development; Economic growths; Global temperature change; Human development; Income distribution; Poverty; Poverty alleviation; Projection analysis; SDG1; Socio-economic development; climate change; economic development; income distribution; poverty alleviation; socioeconomic conditions; Sustainable Development Goal; Climate change","","","","","United States Agency for International Development, USAID, (38054); Holding Our Own & the Women's Building, (38344)","","Aguilar G.R., Sumner A., Who are the world’s poor?

While datasets on income distribution collected from household surveys are available for multiple countries, these datasets often do not represent the same concept of inequality (or income concept) and therefore make comparisons across countries, over time and across datasets difficult. Here, we present a consistent dataset of income distributions across 190 countries from 1958 to 2015 measured in terms of net income. We complement the observed values in this dataset with values imputed from a summary measure of the income distribution, specifically the Gini coefficient. For the imputation, we use a recently developed nonparametric principal-component-based approach that shows an excellent fit to data on income distributions compared to other approaches. We also present another version of this dataset aggregated from the country level to 32 geographical regions. Our dataset is developed for the purpose of calibrating models such as integrated human–Earth system models with detailed data on income distributions. This dataset will enable more robust analysis of income distribution at multiple scales.

Moreover, Chinese reproductive health has shown a clear decline. Thus, it is imperative to determine the precipitating causes and the root causes of this decline. Environmental and climate risks (ECRs) may cause the decline in reproductive health. Experimental findings have shown that the impact of ECRs on reproductive health can be passed down from both males and females to their offspring, demonstrating an intergenerational and transgenerational lag effect. We perceive that the declined reproductive health may lead to negative demographic consequences in China; therefore, we suggest the following five regulations be implemented: (i) prevent Chinese of childbearing age from exposure to ECRs; (ii) further develop and promote assisted reproductive technology and set up sperm and ovum banks on a national scale; (iii) quantitatively establish the causality between fathers and mothers who suffer from ECRs and the impaired reproductive health in their progeny; (iv) teach ECRs-health knowledge in psychotherapeutic training and continuing education; and (v) propagate and further promote common prosperity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Assisted reproductive technology; Environmental and climate risks; Family planning; Infertility; Intergenerational and transgenerational lag effect","China; Climate Change; Female; Humans; Infertility; Male; Reproductive Health; attitude to health; birth rate; China; climate change; cultural diversity; environmental exposure; environmental risk; epigenetic modification; family planning; family structure; female; fertility; genital system disease; growth rate; health education; health insurance; human; illegal abortion; income inequality; infertility therapy; law enforcement; life expectancy; low birth weight; male; maternal diabetes mellitus; mortality rate; Note; ovarian reserve; pollution; population growth; prematurity; preterm rupture of membranes; progeny; psychotherapy; reproductive health; sperm bank; sperm count; sperm quality; spermatozoon density; sustainable development; transgenerational lag effect; infertility","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFC2700073); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82201880); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (226-2024-00040); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This study was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFC2700073), National Science Foundation of China (No. 82201880), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 226-2024-00040).","Aitken J., Et al., Seeds of concern, Nature, 432, pp. 48-52, (2004); Basu R., Et al., Association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents and preterm delivery in California, 2000–2006, Paediatr.

This study examines how high temperature affects within-firm wage inequality using Chinese listed companies from 2006 to 2020. Results suggest that high temperature significantly increases managerial compensation while reducing employee wages, thereby exacerbating within-firm wage inequality. The main driver is the disparity in bargaining power between management and employees. China's 2012 heat subsidy policy has mitigated this inequality. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that in environments where employees wield more bargaining power, such as state-owned enterprises, sectors employing highly skilled workers, and regions with stronger unions, the negative impact is less pronounced. Conversely, in developed managerial markets, regulated industries, and large enterprises, where management holds stronger bargaining power, this impact is notably significant. These findings offer crucial insights for policymakers and stakeholders in addressing climate risks and regulating income distribution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Bargaining power; China; High temperature; Within-firm wage inequality","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Technical change, inequality, and the labor market, J.

For effective and salient policy, engaging citizens, especially young generations, who will experience those policies firsthand is crucial. This work aims to define and test new food systems sustainability indicators through youth engagement for policy insights to provide policymakers with literature incorporating citizens' needs. Our approach is based on Community Dissonance Theory and the application of a literature review, focus groups and survey. Four future food systems scenarios were obtained through the literature, serving as a baseline for discussion for Generation Z focus groups, whose results were analyzed through NVivo. In this work 31 food system indicators were identified, 20 on social aspects, 9 economic and one environmental. Social indicators proposed were related to capacity development, education, vulnerable groups, income inequality, social awareness, and increased stakeholders' engagement measures. Economic ones are on stakeholders' bargaining power and purchasing power, while environmental ones are on climate change. The combination of these scenarios contributed to identifying top priorities in terms of social, economic, and environmental indicators, which in terms of policy suggestions, could: balance economic, social, and environmental objectives within food systems; address potential impacts of policies beyond specific scenarios since they are inferred from a multitude of scenarios; reconcile short- and long-term priorities as areas of interventions within food supply chains; and engage young stakeholders to inform coherent policymaking. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Citizen engagement; Food security; Future foresight; Scenario analysis; Social learning","bargaining; climate change; decision making; food security; food supply; local participation; sustainability; adult; Article; awareness; catering service; climate change; environmental indicator; female; food; government; human; income; income inequality; information processing; international cooperation; male; migration; policy; population growth; practice guideline; purchasing power; qualitative analysis; social media; social network; sustainable development","","","","","","","Andersen P.D., Hansen M., Selin C., Stakeholder inclusion in scenario planning—A review of European projects, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 169, (2021); Asioli D., Aschemann-Witzel J., Nayga R.M., Sustainability-related food labels, Annual Review of Resource Economics, 12, pp. 171-185, (2020); Aubert F., Frere Q., Lepicier D., Vedrine L., Decentralization and rural development policies effectiveness: a quasi-experimental evaluation of the LEADER programme, Regional Studies, pp. 1-11, (2022); Barrett C.B., Actions now can curb food systems fallout from COVID-19, Nature Food, 1, 6, pp. 319-320, (2020); Benton T.G., Using scenario analyses to address the future of food, EFSA Journal, 17, (2019); Blodgett D.M., Feld M.N., Teaching an interdisciplinary course in sustainable food systems: science and history meet in “a world that works, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 24, 9, pp. 138-158, (2023); Bogenschneider K., Corbett T.J., Parrott E., Realizing the promise of research in policymaking: Theoretical guidance grounded in policymaker perspectives, Journal of Family Theory & Review, 11, 1, pp. 127-147, (2019); Caplan N., The two-communities theory and knowledge utilization, American behavioral scientist, 22, 3, pp. 459-470, (1979); Copeland C., MacKerron G., Foxon T.J., Futures for Findhorn: Exploring challenges for achieving net zero in an ecological intentional community, Futures, 149, (2023); Cork S., Using futures thinking to support ecosystem assessments, Routledge Handbook of Ecosystem Services, pp. 170-187, (2015); (2022); Desiderio E., Garcia-Herrero L., Hall D., Segre A., Vittuari M., Social sustainability tools and indicators for the food supply chain: a systematic literature review, Sustain.

The US refuses to renew the mandate of judges on the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Appellate Body, which means that WTO rules are no longer enforceable unless the US (or any other member) chooses to comply. The Biden Administration has shown no interest in new bilateral or regional trade deals. This paper adopts a historical perspective to examine the causes behind the turn in US trade policy and speculates about its future course. Even today, the US economy remains among the world’s most open, public opinion supports trade and advocates of withdrawal from world markets are hard to find. Accordingly, interpreting the change of US trade policy as an outright embrace of protectionism is overly simple, in fact misleading. A more accurate interpretation is that US trade policy has changed, impelled – as it has been over two and a half centuries – by underlying forces. In this episode, it is the rise of China and its challenge to a US-led world order, high income inequality (combined with inadequate social safety nets), and climate change that force an adaptation of US trade policy. Not surprisingly, these forces create opportunities for calls for protection among powerful constituencies that can profit from it. This helps us understand Biden’s policies, but it does not justify them: the present US trade policy is not the right response to these challenges. Past cycles of US trade policy suggest that another rethinking of US trade policy is possible and even likely, especially since there is no support for closing the US economy. Unfortunately, a return to US trade leadership is not in the cards any time soon, and when it comes, it may be too late to salvage the rules-based trading system. © 2023 Editions Dalloz Sirey.

On the basis of analyzing the mechanism of climate change’s impact on urban–rural income gap, this article empirically analyzes the impact of climate change on urban–rural income gap using provincial-level panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020. Research indicates that climate change significantly impacts the urban–rural income gap at the 1% significance level, implying that climate change exacerbates the urban–rural income gap. This widening effect varies significantly across different regions, particularly in the western regions and areas with lower fiscal support for agriculture. Further analysis reveals that there is a mediating role between the total agricultural output value and resource mismatch in the impact of climate change on urban–rural income inequality; the digital rural construction plays a regulatory role in the impact of climate change on the urban–rural income gap.

Digital finance, an emergent form of industry that fused advanced technology with financial services, had a pronounced impact on household carbon emissions stemming from daily consumption. However, the mechanisms driving this impact have not been adequately examined. Based on micro-level household survey data across 25 Chinese provinces from 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018, the study identified the chief channels via which digital finance affected household carbon emissions, deriving several key findings. First, digital finance augmented household carbon emissions, presenting a significant negative impact on the climate. Second, due to the existence of “digital divide” between rural and urban areas, the impact of digital finance was more subdued in rural areas. Additionally, the effects of digital finance were more pronounced in the affluent eastern provinces. Third, income mobility obscured the positive relationship between digital finance and household carbon emissions. This is primarily attributed to the urban-rural divide in China; taking into account that urban-to-rural transfers make income distribution more equitable, there is a counterintuitive drop in per capita consumption, thereby suppressing consumption-related carbon emissions. This presented the conundrum of “income distribution equality—consumption negativity”. Finally, financial literacy was identified as a crucial positive moderating role, enabling households with high financial literacy to harness the dividends of digital finance, thereby engaging in more diversified consumption activities and intensifying the negative impact of digital finance on carbon emissions. The findings reinforced the pivotal role of digital finance in bolstering efforts to combat climate change and ensuring environmentally-responsible economic advancements. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Digital finance; Financial literacy; Household carbon emissions; Income mobility; IV-MA; Obscuring effect","Carbon; China; Climate Change; Economic Development; Income; Literacy; China; Carbon; Climate change; Rural areas; carbon; Carbon emissions; Digital finance; Financial literacy; Household carbon emission; Income distribution; Income inequality; Income mobility; IV-MA; Obscuring effect; Primary sources; advanced technology; carbon emission; climate change; digitization; financial services; household survey; income distribution; rural area; urban area; Article; benchmarking; carbon emission; China; climate; climate change; digital divide; ecosystem resilience; finance; household; household income; human; income; income distribution; income inequality; literacy; rural area; urban area; urban rural difference; economic development; income; Finance","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, ","","","Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology in Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, (NJYT22102); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72104114, 72174186, 72363024, U21B20102); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, NMG, (STZX202223); Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, NMG","This work is supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U21B20102 , 72363024 , 72104114 , 72174186 ), Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology in Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region ( NJYT22102 ), and Research Project on Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality of Higher Education Institutions in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region ( STZX202223 ).

Understanding the factors that influence GHG emissions is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study focuses on Mexico, a country that has experienced substantial economic and social changes over the past two decades. The primary objective was to analyze the impact of various economic and social variables on GHG emissions in Mexico using correlation and Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis. The variables under consideration included Gross Domestic Product (GDP), energy consumption, population, per capita income, income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient), and educational levels. Results showed that GDP, energy consumption, and population are positively correlated with GHG emissions and negatively correlated with income inequality. The Granger causality analysis showed that GDP and per capita income are strong predictors of GHG emissions; in contrast, income inequality and educational levels do not exhibit direct causative impacts on emissions. Finally, it was found that higher educational levels may contribute to lower GHG emissions. With this evidence, climate policies in Mexico can be formulated by addressing key areas, and policymakers can design strategies that effectively manage and reduce GHG emissions, aligning with sustainable development goals and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. © 2024 by the authors.","climate policy; economic variables; greenhouse gas emissions; Mexico; social variables; vector autoregression analysis","Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; analytical method; economic impact; environmental policy; global climate; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; social impact; Sustainable Development Goal; vector autoregression","","","","","","","Tuckett R., Greenhouse Gases, Encyclopedia of Analytical Science, pp. 362-372, (2018); Climate Change 101: Climate Science Basics; Verifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Methods to Support International Climate Agreements, (2010); Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States; Gilli M., Calcaterra M., Emmerling J., Granella F., Climate change impacts on the within-country income distributions, J.

Whilst such goals are often framed from the perspective of high-income countries, low-income countries struggle to balance their carbon-intensive growth strategies with poverty alleviation, and carbon emission reduction. Combined with the prospect of economic growth driving income inequality higher, the potential for a vicious cycle to emerge in low-income countries in particular is considerable. Whilst the negative association between economic growth and poverty is well established, the effectiveness of growth-based programmes as a poverty reduction strategy in the context of climate change and inequality is less certain. We explore the prospects of balancing these development goals and their consequences using an international dataset, and generalized method of moments estimators. We find that although economic development reduces poverty, carbon emissions (from carbon-intensive growth) coupled with inequality, exacerbates poverty. Secondly, we find that in terms of poverty reduction, poor countries are negatively impacted by both carbon emissions and income inequality, while rich countries are primarily impacted by income inequality. Finally, we find the effect of emissions on poverty is stronger for countries at higher poverty levels, suggesting that international policies aimed at achieving equitable emissions reduction should consider the potential for disproportionate negative impacts on poorer countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Economic growth; Income inequality; Poverty","carbon emission; climate change; economic growth; income distribution; poverty alleviation; Sustainable Development Goal","","","","","Irish Research Council, (GOIPG/2021/441); Irish Research Council","The research conducted in this publication was funded by the Irish Research Council under award number GOIPG/2021/441.

However, theoretical consensus regarding climate risk insurance remains elusive, and the implementation of climate insurance policies varies markedly between countries owing to various challenges. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of 1082 relevant publications (1975–2022) to determine the theoretical basis, evolution of research hotspots, and methodologies associated with climate risk insurance. Climate insurance publications are growing at an average annual rate of 8.9%, with more than 2333 authors from 1103 organizations in 78 countries publishing on the subject. On the basis of milestones of global climate change assessment, i.e., the publication of the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate insurance research can be divided into three major phases. In the start-up phase (1975–2007), research schemes examined the feasibilities and potentials of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States, and the socioeconomic implications of transferring climate risk through reinsurance. The methodologies used in these studies were relatively simple owing to lack of comprehensive data. Research on flood insurance increased rapidly during the development phase (2008–2014), with increasing emphasis on the possibility of developing a flood insurance market in the Netherlands. Studies utilized catastrophe modeling and probabilistic approaches to estimate natural disaster losses and financial impacts. The boom phase (2015–2022) involved more research on the affordability of climate risk insurance given income inequality. The topic of climate insurance and the scope of its impact have developed global and interdisciplinary characteristics in terms of journal, sector, and disciplinary base. In the future, a trend might develop whereby big data will be combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning to design and implement index insurance. © 2023 The Authors","Adaptation; Bibliometric analysis; Climate change; Climate risk insurance; Network analysis","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (22AZD098); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This work was supported by the key projects of the National Social Science Fund of China ( 22AZD098 ).

Alcohol, the most used and abused substance in Bhutan, is associated with high rates of mortality, morbidity, suicide, and violence. The per capita consumption of pure alcohol among adults significantly exceeds global consumption, leading to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) being the primary cause of mortality among the male population in Bhutan. The country's long and porous border with India poses challenges to law enforcement agencies due to the easy accessibility of substances. While ""hard drugs"" are not prevalent, teenagers often begin experimenting with volatile substances before progressing to cannabis. More harmful substances include pharmaceutical products containing opioids, which are available in India by prescription but are banned in Bhutan. © The Author(s).

The results show that CCPs are associated with a significant and persistent increase in income inequality. The effect is robust across various measures of inequality and sensitivity tests, including an instrumental variable strategy. The effect of CCPs only materializes in the case of market-based CCPs, is stronger in countries characterized by a higher share of low-educated workers and initial level of inequality, while is mitigated in those with comprehensive redistribution policies, and during periods of fiscal expansions and stronger economic growth. These findings have important policy implications, as they emphasize the importance of the timing and design of CCPs, as well as the role of complementary policies. © 2024 The Authors","Climate change policy; Income inequality; Local projections; SDGs","Climate change; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Climate change policies; Dynamic impacts; Economic growths; Income inequality; Instrumental variables; Local projections; Policy implications; SDG; Sensitivity tests; Workers'; climate change; economic growth; educational attainment; environmental policy; Sustainable Development Goal; wage gap; working conditions; Public policy","","","","","","","Abrell J., Ndoye A., Zachmann G., Assessing the Impact of the EU ETS Using Firm Level Data, (2011); Adamson E., Clifford S., Wallace T., Smith J.A., Industry views about the banned drinker register in the Northern Territory: early lessons from a qualitative evaluation, Drug Alcohol Rev., 40, 2, pp. 210-219, (2021); Ahir H., Bloom N., Furceri D., The World Uncertainty Index, (2022); Albrizio S., Kozluk T., Zipperer V., Environmental policies and productivity growth: evidence across industries and firms, J.

Based on a coupling between a microeconomic model of European agriculture (AROPAj) and a crop model (STICS), this article investigates the potential distributional impacts of farm-level autonomous adaptation to climate change within the European Union (EU-27). Considering the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 of the second report on emission scenario of the fifth assessment report (SRES AR5), we implement two levels of autonomous adaptation for farmers, and three time horizons. The results indicate that ceteris paribus, climate change may lead in terms of social welfare to a slightly worse situation in the middle term and a slightly better situation in the long term with respect to the present. However, the ranking of agents in the distribution is importantly impacted. Our Shapley inequality decomposition shows that income inequality is largely explained by the region and type of farming. Climate change barely affects the marginal contribution of these two characteristics to overall income inequality. © 2024 The Author(s)","Autonomous adaptation; Climate change; European agriculture; Income inequality; Inequality decomposition","Europe; climate change; climate conditions; decomposition analysis; equity; European Union; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","","","Aaberge R., Axiomatic characterization of the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve orderings, J.

Evidence is drawn from Toyota and dozens of other companies that have countered these myths to build strong collaborative cultures and achieve sustainable growth. Arguments are reinforced by the latest science on human behavior and systems theory and supported by more than 60 interviews from prominent CEOs, consultants, academics, executive directors, and EVPs in the context of today's pressing global issues, including labor shortage, income inequality, job-related stress, supply chain instability, and climate change. In this book, readers will learn: Why we are facing a global productivity crisis despite what the news media are telling us Why frontline employees aren't to blame for low productivity, and that the boss doesn't always know best Why the whole does not equal the sum of the parts, and that the past doesn't necessarily determine the future Why a strong workplace culture is the essential enabler for high productivity, and how to instill it As companies face the new realities of the global economy, Productivity Reimagined is an essential resource for forward-thinking executives, managers, and business leaders looking to solve the productivity puzzle and empower their workforces to perform at their best. © 2025 by Jacob Stoller.

Lower-income households, the less educated, and parts of the lower middle class bear the brunt of rising costs resulting from climate policies. In contrast, wealthier households, despite contributing more to CO2 emissions, experience fewer financial implications and have a better capacity to adapt. The new German government takes steps to compensate lower-income households through measures like covering the EEG levy with taxes and additional climate payments, yet the effectiveness of these actions remains in question. Achieving climate goals requires rigorous control of complex processes related to dismantling, renovation, and construction. Collaboration between the state and private enterprises is emphasized to establish a socially ecological market economy. Adapting individual behavior for climate protection poses challenges, as restrictive policies have been met with resistance. Many parties now prioritize technological advancements and positive incentives to encourage climate-friendly practices. In conclusion, climate policy has the potential to either deepen societal divisions or strengthen social cohesion. This underscores the importance of broad inclusivity, new participation models, and reforms within existing forums. © The Author(s) 2024.

The abstract of the article is given below: Abstract In low-income countries, there exists a common concern about the effect of hunger and food insecurity on educational outcomes. However, income inequalities, economic slowdown, conflict, and climate change have raised those concerns globally. Yet, little is known about how widespread the problem of hunger in schools is worldwide. This study examines child hunger and student achievement internationally, using data from the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019. To examine the relationship between hunger and student achievement, we fitted multilevel models to the data and controlled for student SES, class SES, teacher experience, and teacher educational attainment. The results suggest that hunger among students is not exclusive to low-income countries. Instead, child hunger is a common issue around the world, affecting about onethird of children and exacerbating unequal education opportunities globally. Controlling for other variables, the achievement gap between students who never come to school hungry and those who come to school always or almost always hungry is significant and deserves our attention. A clear policy recommendation from our results suggests that all countries that participated in TIMSS need to examine their school meal programs and explore ways to feed the students who show up to school hungry. The original paper has now been corrected. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Canbolat Y., Rutkowski D., Rutkowski L., Global pattern in hunger and educational opportunity: A multilevel analysis of child hunger and TIMSS mathematics achievement, Large-Scale Assess Educ, 11, (2023)","Y.

This paper highlights the causal impact of drought on income inequality using a new methodology known as the quantile treatment effect on the treated under the copula stability assumption. This method generalizes the difference-in-differences framework to the entire distribution. The methodology is applied to a geo-referenced and nationally representative household survey of two sub-Saharan African countries: Ethiopia and Malawi. The results show that droughts worsen income inequality in both countries. Lower income quantiles are subject to a higher decrease in per capita income, up to 40% for the lowest income quantile. In contrast, higher income quantiles are largely unaffected or appear to benefit from the drought. These results are robust to several specifications and offer quantitative insights into how extreme weather conditions affect inequality dynamics in developing countries. Inequality formation is driven by differences in the ability to cope with droughts. The results show that wealthier households have a higher capacity to find alternative sources of income to prevent a welfare drop. In contrast, the most vulnerable households, particularly those that are low in assets, remote, or headed by women or older individuals, are most seriously harmed. Finally, consumption-smoothing behaviors and asset depletion strategies in middle income households are also observed. © 2025 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association.","adaptation; Africa; drought; inequality","Ethiopia; Malawi; climate change; developing world; drought; extreme event; household income; household survey; income distribution","","","","","Climate Economic Chair; CSAE; AgEconMeet; ICDE; EAAE; EAERE Winter School on Natural Resources and Development; AFSE; Agriculture and Forestry; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR‐16‐CONV‐0003); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","Funding text 1: Thank you to the three anonymous reviewers for their engaging discussions and useful suggestions.

Here we quantify the inequality repercussions of direct air capture of CO2 in a 1.5 °C scenario, using a regional integrated assessment model that features within-country income heterogeneity. We find that, under a single carbon market, financing negative emissions technologies could double the increase in income inequality of climate policy. The effects are highest around the time of net zero and in scenarios with carbon budget overshoot. We identify the drivers of the inequality increase and discuss policy provisions to mitigate the equity concerns of CO2 removal strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","carbon budget; carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; environmental policy; equity; private sector; temperature effect","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (821124)","","Rathi A., Stripe, Alphabet and others to spend nearly $1 billion on carbon removal, BNN Bloomberg, (2022); Shukla P.R., Et al., IPCC Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, (2022); Fuss S., Et al., Negative emissions—part 2: costs, potentials and side effects, Environ.

The use of ICT is still relatively low in many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and its adoption is complex. Humane-oriented entrepreneurs are probably more aware of the serious challenges we face, such as climate change and income inequality. Thus, a humane orientation may become instrumental in actually promoting the use of technology to confront such challenges. This research is one of the first attempts to analyse the moderating role of a humane orientation in the context of ICT adoption. Partial least squares (PLS) was used to test the model, and SmartPLS software was employed to conduct the estimations. Besides validating the applicability of UTAUT, the results confirm that the relationship between the attitude towards ICT and ICT use intention is stronger for humane-orientated respondents. These findings may be useful for entrepreneurship support centres since they could include specific humane and ICT contents in their programmes to enhance effectiveness. © 2024 Edward Elgar Publishing.","Humane entrepreneurship; ICT adoption; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)","","","","","","","","Abushakra A., Nikbin D., Odeh A., Abdulwahab R., The effect of trust, IT knowledge, and entrepreneur’s innovativeness to embrace or shun the internet of things, Frontiers in Psychology, 13, (2022); Afawubo K., Noglo Y.A., ICT and entrepreneurship: A comparative analysis of developing, emerging and developed countries, Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 175, (2022); Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior, Action Control, pp. 11-39, (1985); Al-Gahtani S.S., Hubona G.S., Wang J., Information technology (IT) in Saudi Arabia: Culture and the acceptance and use of IT, Information & Management, 44, 8, pp. 681-691, (2007); Alshebami A.S., Crowdfunding platforms as a substitute financing source for young Saudi entrepreneurs: Empirical evidence, SAGE Open, 12, 3, (2022); Andrews J.E., Wards H., Yoon J.W., UTAUT as a model for understanding intention to adopt AI and related technologies among librarians, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 47, (2021); Apfel D., Herbes C., What drives Senegalese SMEs to adopt renewable energy technologies?

This study aims to contribute to the current policy discourse of India by examining the asymmetric and symmetric effects of income inequality and FDI on carbon emissions with the augmentation of non-linear and linear autoregressive distributive lag model technique and using time series data from 1990 to 2021. Findings indicate that positive shock on income inequality reduces emissions, while the same on FDI increases emissions. Further, negative shock on both income inequality and FDI shows an insignificant influence on carbon dioxide emissions. The study not only confirms the presence of the pollution haven hypothesis for India but also provides evidence of conflict between the sustainable development goal (SDG-10) of reducing income inequality and the goal of climate change mitigation (SDG-13). In addition, the human development index has been found to aggravate carbon emissions. The study highlights the policy challenges of harmonizing India's SDGs with its economic growth. It suggests significant policy changes to strategically prioritize foreign direct investment projects that are in line with SDG13. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","CO<sub>2</sub>e; Foreign direct investment; Human development index; Income inequality; India; Sustainable development goals","carbon emission; climate change; foreign direct investment; human development index; income distribution; Sustainable Development Goal; three-dimensional modeling","","","","","","","Abdo A.B., Li B., Zhang X., Lu J., Rasheed A., Influence of FDI on environmental pollution in selected Arab countries: A spatial econometric analysis perspective, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 22, pp. 28222-28246, (2020); Adekoya O.B., Olabode J.K., Rafi S.K., Renewable energy consumption, carbon emissions and human development: Empirical comparison of the trajectories of world regions, Renewable Energy, 179, pp. 1836-1848, (2021); Akbar M., Hussain A., Akbar A., Ullah I., The dynamic association between healthcare spending, CO2e, and human development index in OECD countries: Evidence from panel VAR model, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 23, 7, pp. 10470-10489, (2021); Ali S., Yusop Z., Kaliappan S.R., Chin L., Dynamic common correlated effects of trade openness, FDI, and institutional performance on environmental quality: Evidence from OIC countries, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, pp. 11671-11682, (2020); Alola A.A., Bekun F.V., Sarkodie S.A., Dynamic impact of trade policy, economic growth, fertility rate, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on ecological footprint in Europe, Science of the Total Environment, 685, pp. 702-709, (2019); Arfanuzzaman M., Impact of CO<sub>2</sub> emission, per capita income and HDI on Environmental Performance Index: Empirical evidence from Bangladesh, International Journal of Green Economics, 10, 3-4, pp. 213-225, (2016); Asongu S.A., Odhiambo N.M., Environmental degradation and inclusive human development in sub-Saharan Africa, Sustainable Development, 27, 1, pp. 25-34, (2019); Ayad H., Haseeb M., Djedaiet A., Hossain M.E., Kamal M., Investigating the nexus between trade policy uncertainty and environmental quality in the USA: Empirical evidence from aggregate and disaggregate level analysis, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 18, pp. 51995-52012, (2023); Baloch M.A., Khan S.U.D., Ulucak Z.S., Ahmad A., Analyzing the relationship between poverty, income inequality, and CO<sub>2</sub> emission in Sub-Saharan African countries, Science of the Total Environment, 740, (2020); Bandyopadhyay A., Rej S., Can nuclear energy fuel an environmentally sustainable economic growth?

Using a novel, participatory, systems dynamics modeling approach–the Ethiopia Green Economy Model (GEM)–the authors assess a NZE pathway against a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario to 2050. Assumptions, design of the model, and features of the pathways were gathered through a collaborative initiative, working with representatives of the government of Ethiopia and local experts. The assessment compares the costs of implementing BAU versus NZE development pathways to the co-benefits of climate action. A key policy question is: how will climate action impact growth and investment as well as poverty, income inequality, employment, and ecosystem services? This analysis shows that moving onto a NZE pathway could raise Ethiopia’s GDP growth to 8.1 percent compared to 6.7 percent per year under BAU from 2020 to 2050. Implementation of NZE is estimated to raise cumulative investment costs as well compared to BAU by 2050 but yields significantly more in co-benefits and avoided costs combined, with the latter mainly from energy savings. Economic performance under the NZE pathway will bring about economic structural change, with a decline in agricultural GDP offset by growth in industry and the service sector. Beyond economic growth, a NZE pathway is expected to create employment co-benefits, adding green jobs, while also bringing about faster reduction of extreme and moderate poverty and raising average disposable income. Overall, this broad economy-wide analysis shows a benefit to cost ratio (BCR) greater than 1 by 2030, with $1.04 of benefits generated for every dollar invested, rising to nearly triple this by 2050. Implementation challenges include the need for a dedicated financing strategy and complementary policies to ensure a just transition for unskilled workers; not examined in any detail here, these are topics ripe for future work. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate resilience; development policy; Ethiopia; mitigation policy; Net zero emissions; poverty reduction","","","","","","","","Abera B., (2023); Alebachew A., Bewket W., A climate change country assessment report for Ethiopia, (2011); Bassi A., Garrido L., Harsono A., Pallaske G., Informing national climate action with the green economy model: A technical description of the structures and processes, World Resources Institute, (2024); Carrapatoso A., Kurzinger E., Climate-resilient development: Participatory solutions from developing countries, Routledge studies in sustainable development, (2014); Castle S.E., Miller D.C., Ordonez P.J., Baylis K., Hughes K., The impacts of agroforestry interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review, Campbell Systematic Reviews, 17, 2, (2021); Cohen B., Cowie A., Babiker M., Leip A., Smith P., Co-benefits and trade-offs of climate change mitigation actions and the Sustainable Development Goals, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 26, pp. 805-813, (2021); Landscape of climate finance in Ethiopia, (2022); Cutler E., Guzzetti M., Sustainable asset valuation of land restoration in Sodo District, Southern Ethiopia.

Results by the GMM estimator confirm that increases in income inequality and investments in human capital exacerbate environmental degradation in Asian countries. However, among the three variables that represent human capital, only HC3 (Gross enrollment ratio for tertiary school) plays a role in reducing the impact of income inequality on emissions of carbon dioxide. In addition, the study also provides evidence on the impact of other factors on CO2 emissions such as renewable energy, economic growth, population, output in the agricultural and services sectors, trade openness, government expenditure and total investment in the economy. Besides, some important policy implications have been suggested to aim at securing sustained economic growth in Asia. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","","","","","University of Finance","The authors acknowledge being supported by the University of Finance - Marketing, Viet Nam.

However, their effects on income inequality are less understood. We estimate the dynamic impact of thunderstorms on income and wages and reveal a robust asymmetric effect. We leverage a comprehensive dataset covering more than 200,000 events affecting contiguous U.S. counties across three decades. Storms have caused the highest number of billion-dollar disaster events since the eighties, but they have the lowest average event cost. They are short-lived, locally confined, relatively frequent, difficult-to-predict, and hazardous albeit not fully destructive events. While such features are convenient for the identification of impacts, previous studies mostly focused on more extreme events. We document a robust negative association between storm activity, income and wages growth. While income tends to recover in the long run, wages exhibit a significantly more stubborn decline, suggesting persistent and adverse impacts on (functional) income inequality. A one standard deviation increase in wind exposure generates a loss of 0.15% (0.21%) in wages after three (nine) years; incomes fall by a larger extent initially (0.19% after three years) while fully recovering in the longer run. In addition to their notable asymmetry, such estimates are non-negligible—especially given the downward rigidity of U.S. wages. Our analyses also highlight a lack of effective adaptation and stronger negative impacts in economically disadvantaged regions. Finally, we find evidence for a sizable shock-absorbing role of federal assistance. © 2024","Adaptation policies; Climate change; Growth; Income inequality; Natural hazards; Storms","United States; Adaptation policies; Asymmetric effects; Dynamic impacts; Extreme events; Income inequality; Lower average; Natural hazard; Performance; Storm activities; Weather events; adaptive management; climate change; growth rate; natural hazard; policy approach; rigidity; storm; thunderstorm; Thunderstorms","","","","","European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC; FIND, (101117427)","Funding text 1: Matteo Coronese, Francesco Lamperti, Francesca Chiaromonte and Andrea Roventini acknowledge the financial support of the Department of Excellence Law, Economics and Management in the era of Data Science (L'EMbeDS).

Whether these conditions can trigger ventricular arrhythmias [ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, VT/VF] in susceptible persons is unknown. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between warm-season weather conditions and risk of VT/VF in individuals with pacemakers and defibrillators. Methods: Baseline clinical and device data from 5,944 patients in North Carolina (2010-2021) were linked to daily weather data geocoded to individuals’ residential addresses. Associations between extreme humidity, temperature, and VT/VF overall and by patient, community, and built environment factors were estimated using a case time-series design with distributed lag nonlinear models, adjusting for temporal trends and individual factors. Results: VT/VF events occurred on 4,486 of the 484,988 person-days. Extreme humidity (95th percentile: 90% relative humidity) increased odds of VT/VF in the 7 days following exposure (aOR 1.23 [95% CI: 1.00-1.51]). Humidity-associated VT/VF risk was highest among those who were male (aOR: 1.38 [95% CI: 1.08-1.76]), age 67 to 75 years (aOR: 1.65 [95% CI: 1.16-2.35]) with coronary artery disease (aOR: 1.79 [95% CI: 1.25-2.57]), heart failure (aOR: 1.72 [95% CI: 1.2-2.46]), diabetes (aOR: 3.01 [95% CI: 1.99-4.56]), hypertension (aOR: 2.06 [95% CI: 1.48-2.88]), and prior myocardial infarction (aOR: 1.75 [95% CI: 1.23-2.48]). Communities with high socioeconomic deprivation (aOR: 1.83 [95% CI: 1.28-2.62]), high income inequality (aOR: 1.56 [95% CI: 1.19-2.04]), and urban areas with less greenspace (aOR: 1.29 [95% CI: 0.93-1.78]) also had increased VT/VF risk. High temperatures were not associated with VT/VF. Conclusions: In patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, exposure to extreme humidity increased VT/VF risk, especially among vulnerable individuals, disadvantaged communities, and urban areas with less green space. These findings emphasize the need for policies that address environmental risks in susceptible individuals and communities. © 2024 The Authors","arrhythmia; extreme weather; humidity; implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; pacemaker; Social Determinants; temperature","","","","","","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; Boston Scientific Corporation, BSC; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K23HL141644, UL1TR002489); National Institutes of Health, NIH","Dr Rosman's effort on this study was supported by a grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (K23HL141644).

We use Chinese prefecture-level cities as the research sample to examine the economic impact of CPU on income inequality. We find that (1) CPU exacerbates income inequality by promoting agglomeration effect, technological bias effect, and automation effect. (2) The negative impact of CPU on income inequality is not obvious in the central region, high administrative level, high capital allocation ability, low labour allocation ability and resource-based cities. (3) Shock duration, effects (as opposed to climate physical risks), and other impacts are examined. Command-and-control environmental regulations can mitigate the potential impacts of CPU, whereas market-based environmental regulations have limited effectiveness. This study examines the potential impacts of CPU on balanced development and high-quality development, providing new insights for the formulation of climate policies and the management of policy risks associated with climate change. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate policy; income inequality; risk response; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Directed Technical Change, Review of Economic Studies, 69, 4, pp. 781-809, (2002); Acemoglu D., Technical Change, Inequality, and the Labor Market, Journal of Economic Literature, 40, 1, pp. 7-72, (2002); Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., The Race Between Man and Machine: Implications of Technology for Growth, Factor Shares, and Employment, The American Economic Review, 108, 6, pp. 1488-1542, (2018); Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets, Journal of Political Economy, 128, 6, pp. 2188-2244, (2020); Autor D., Salomons A., Is automation labor-displacing?

Thus, this study investigates how natural resource depletion affects climate change induced vulnerability and income inequalities in Africa. The study employs the novel Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), and panel data of 21 countries spanning from 1994 to 2020 to explore the nexus. The study finds that natural resource deletion has a positive and significant effect on both climate change vulnerability on one hand and income inequality on the other hand. This implies that natural resource depletion significantly worsens both climate change induced vulnerability and income inequality. Consequently, policy makers need to consider the interconnectedness of environmental systems, and ensure that sustainable resource management and preservation policies and practices must take crucial accounts of not only effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies but also environmental and equity concerns, which are crucial for promoting more equitable societies and reducing income disparities. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics and provide insights for policymakers to devise effective strategies for sustainable development in the African region. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Africa; Climate change vulnerability; Income inequality; Method of moments quantile regression; Natural resource depletion","","","","","","","","Abdullah S., Morley B., Environmental taxes and economic growth: Evidence from panel causality tests, Energy Econ, 42, pp. 27-33, (2014); Acharya M., Subedi B., Study of climate change and its impacts on water resource: a case study from Sikles village of Acap Region, ECO Clim Chang, 3, 2, pp. 89-94, (2022); Acheampong A.O., Dzator J., Abunyewah M., Erdiaw-Kwasie M.O., Opoku E.E.O., Sub-Saharan Africa’s tragedy: Resource curse, democracy and income inequality, Soc Indic Res, 168, 1, pp. 471-509, (2023); Heliyon the Impact of Technological Innovation on Renewable Energy Production: Accounting for the Roles of Economic and Environmental Factors Using a Method of Moments Quantile Regression; Adeleye B.N., Id R.O., Lawal A.I., de Alwis T., Energy use and the role of per capita income on carbon emissions in African countries, 1–17, (2021); Ajide K.B., Is natural resource curse thesis an empirical regularity for economic complexity in Africa?, Resour Policy, 76, (2022); Alhassan A., Usman O., Ike G.N., Sarkodie S.A., Impact assessment of trade on environmental performance: accounting for the role of government integrity and economic development in 79 countries, Heliyon, 6, 9, (2020); Alvarez-Verdejo E., Moya-Fernandez P.J., Munoz-Rosas J.F., Single Imputation Methods and Confidence Intervals for the Gini Index, (2021); Anser M.K., Adeleye B.N., Tabash M.I., Current issues in tourism services trade–ict–tourism nexus in selected Asian countries: New evidence from panel data techniques, Curr Issues Tour, pp. 1-16, (2021); Antwi-Agyei P., Biran A., Peasey A., Bruce J., Ensink J., A faecal exposure assessment of farm workers in Accra, Ghana: A cross sectional study, BMC Public Health, 16, 1, pp. 1-13, (2016); Avom D., Ntsame Ovono N., Ongo Nkoa E., Revisiting the effects of natural resources on income inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa, Int J Dev Issues, 21, 3, pp. 389-412, (2022); Beladi H., Chen P.H., Chu H., Hu M.Y., Lai C.C., Environmental taxes and economic growth with multiple growth engines, B.E.

The main result is an increased consensus on many economic propositions, specifically the appropriate role of fiscal policy in macroeconomics and income distribution issues. Economists now embrace the role of fiscal policy in a way not apparent in previous surveys and largely support government policies that mitigate income inequality. Another area of consensus is the concern with climate change and the use of appropriate policy tools to address it. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","American Economic Association; changes in opinion; consensus; economists’ views; survey","","","","","","Weber State’s Goddard School of Business and Economics Brown Bag Seminar","Sydney Photiadis provided excellent research assistance for the literature review.

Crop diversification also helps in environmental protection and adaptation to climate change; checks degradation of natural resources including soils and contributes towards attaining eight out of the seventeen sustainable development goals. It is, therefore, important to understand salient characteristics and performance of agricultural households diversifying to such crops to devise suitable strategies to promote crop diversification. This study, using data from situation assessment surveys of 2012-13 and 2018-19, brings out distinguishing characteristics of households diversifying to HVCs and compares their performance in terms of net returns, household income, and consumption expenditure, extent of income inequality and incidence of poverty with non-diversifiers. © 2023 Indian Society of Agricultural Economics.

Using the PMG-ARDL technique, findings reveal that a 1% rise in income inequality leads to a 0.14% decrease in ESG investment in the short term and 0.43% in the long term. Conversely, a 1% increase in household spending on education results in a 0.12% short-term and 0.16% long-term boost in ESG investment. Economic growth does not significantly affect ESG investment, likely due to the sector's profit-driven nature. Additionally, a 1% increase in industry value decreases ESG investment, while better governance practices enhance it. The study suggests that policies focusing on improving governance, reducing inequality, and increasing education spending are crucial for promoting sustainable investments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","ESG investment; G7; PMG-ARDL; Private investment in sustainable projects; Sustainability of fossil fuels extraction industry","Data portal; Environmental, social, and governance investment; Fuel extraction; G7; Income inequality; PMG-ARDL; Private investment; Private investment in sustainable project; Sustainability of fossil fuel extraction industry; Sustainable project; climate change; economic growth; extraction method; fossil fuel; investment; private sector; Spent fuels","","","","","Dong-A University, DAU; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (23CJY082); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","Funding text 1: This research is supported by research funds from Dong-A University.; Funding text 2: This research is supported by National Social Science Fund of China (23CJY082) ","Andreoni P., Reis L., Drouet L., Dessens O., Fragkos P., Pietzcker R., Pye S., Rodrigues R., Tavoni M., Fossil extraction bans and carbon taxes: assessing their interplay through multiple models, iScience, 26, 4, (2023); Assaf C., Monne J., Harriet L., Meunier L., ESG investing: does one score fit all investors' preferences?, J.

For instance, climate change policies that aim to change consumer behavior by increasing the price tag of goods and services that cause carbon emissions often carry a disproportionately higher burden (in terms of financial cost) to those with lower incomes. They can thereby either exacerbate existing income inequalities or contribute to generating new ones. Meanwhile, refraining from engaging with climate mitigation policies will incur other detrimental societal costs: the financial burden and the harmful consequences of climate change that future generations will have to bear if nothing is done. In this paper, we examine how the immediate economic inequality citizens face from climate mitigation policies (regarding carbon taxation) weighs against the long-term generational inequalities future generations will experience. We study how both types of inequality relate to policy support for climate change mitigation policies in the context of Germany. The German case is of special interest because a recent court ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court allows us to test whether making people aware of a new legal reality can bridge the gap between the economic and generational inequality. Our findings using a between-subjects survey experiment fielded among German citizens (N = 6,319) in 2022 show that immediate economic concerns trump future generational concerns, generally making citizens less supportive of the policy. This negative support is however somewhat mitigated by the supportive signal from the court ruling. © 2024 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 38 countries, the authors specify and estimate a panel data model using the generalized least squares method over the period 1991–2020. Robustness is achieved through the generalized moment method-system. Findings: The results show that an increase in vulnerability to climate change is positively and significantly associated with an increase in income inequality. The results also show that the effects of climate change are mediated by gross domestic product/capita, population and agriculture at the 15%, 17% and 24% thresholds, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The authors suggest the implementation of inclusive development policies consistent with climate mitigation and adaptation objectives; the creation of financial spaces from various sources to finance the social security of the most vulnerable; and the strengthening of agricultural resilience to climate-related adverse events, including financing for greenhouse agriculture. Originality/value: On the positive side, it contributes to the literature on the analysis of the direct and indirect effects (transmission channels) of climate change on income inequality in SSA. Methodologically, the study goes beyond previous work as it adopts a stepwise methodology, dealing with the endogeneity issue. At the logical level, it offers some non-exhaustive suggestions of potentially interesting economic policies to guide policymakers in their common commitment to “reduce income inequality” (Sustainable Development Goal 10, target 10.1). © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Income inequality; Sub-Saharan Africa","","","","","","","","Abid M., Impact of economic, financial, and institutional factors on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa economies, Utilities Policy, 41, pp. 85-94, (2016); Abidoye B.O., Odusola A.F., Climate change and economic growth in Africa: an econometric analysis, Journal of African Economies, 24, 2, pp. 277-301, (2015); Adger W.N., Social vulnerability to climate change and extremes in coastal Vietnam, World Development, 27, 2, pp. 249-269, (1999); Althor G., Watson J.E., Fuller R.A., Global mismatch between greenhouse gas emissions and the burden of climate change, Scientific Reports, 6, 1, (2016); Arellano M., Bond S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, The Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Arellano M., Bover O., Another look at the instrumental-variable estimation of error-components models, Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1, pp. 29-52, (1995); Baarsch F., Granadillos J.R., Hare W., Knaus M., Krapp M., Schaeffer M., Lotze-Campen H., The impact of climate change on incomes and convergence in Africa, World Development, 126, (2020); Baek J., Gweisah G., Does income inequality harm the environment?: empirical evidence from the United States, Energy Policy, 62, pp. 1434-1437, (2013); Impact du changement climatique sur l’Afrique subsaharienne: vulnérabilités, résilience et financements bulletin de la banque de France230/4 – Juillet-Août 2020, (2020); Bhatasara S., Debating sociology and climate change, Journal of Integrative Environmental Sciences, 12, 3, pp. 217-233, (2015); Bhorat H., Naidoo K., Odusola A., Cornia G.A., Conceicao P., Income Inequality Trends in Sub-Saharan Africa: Divergence, Determinants, and Consequences, (2017); Bitoto F.E., Ongo E.B.N., Natural resource rents and public spending on education in Africa: does women's political empowerment matter?, Resources Policy, 93, (2024); Blundell R., Bond S., Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models, Journal of Econometrics, 87, 1, pp. 115-143, (1998); Bourguignon F., Morrisson C., Income distribution, development and foreign trade: a cross-sectional analysis, European Economic Review, 34, 6, pp. 1113-1132, (1990); Boyce J.K., Inequality as a cause of environmental degradation, Ecological Economics, 11, 3, pp. 169-178, (1994); Brouwer R., Akter S., Brander L., Haque E., Socioeconomic vulnerability and adaptation to environmental risk: a case study of climate change and flooding in Bangladesh, Risk Analysis, 27, 2, pp. 313-326, (2007); Burke M., Dykema J., Lobell D.B., Miguel E., Shanker S., Incorporating climate uncertainty into estimates of climate change impacts, Review of Economics and Statistics, 97, 2, pp. 461-471, (2015); Byers E., Gidden M., Leclere D., Balkovic J., Burek P., Ebi K., Riahi K., Global exposure and vulnerability to multi-sector development and climate change hotspots, Environmental Research Letters, 13, 5, (2018); Campagnolo L., Davide M., Can the Paris deal boost SDGS achievement?

As climate change increases the vulnerability of coastal communities worldwide, coastal hazard management has become one of the most urgent tasks for ocean governance. While economic development may enhance social resilience, economic inequality, a side effect of economic growth, can play a significant role in social vulnerability to natural hazards. Coastal managers and policymakers urgently need relevant analyses to understand the relationship between economic inequality and marine hazards. Here, we analyzed the links between economic inequality and direct economic losses from storm surge disasters in 11 coastal regions of China between 2000 and 2020. Our results show that provincial income inequality significantly increases direct economic losses from storm surge disasters. For every 1% increase in the provincial disposable income Gini index, annual losses increase by 4.8%–7.8%. Moreover, with a 1% increase in the provincial income gap, relative annual losses (compared with provincial GDP) increase by 0.051%–0.056%. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that losses in northern and eastern marine economic circles are most affected by income inequality. We also find that with increasing economic development level, the aggravating effect of income inequality on losses becomes more significant. Our work indicated that achieving income equity may be a crucial factor for coastal hazard mitigation, which provides new insights into global coastal hazard management. © 2024","Disaster-related loss; Empirical analysis; Income inequality; Storm surge; Tobit regression model","China; Direct economic loss; Disaster-related loss; Economic development; Empirical analysis; Income inequality; Regression modelling; Storm surge disasters; Storm surges; Tobit regression; Tobit regression model; climate change; economic activity; economic development; empirical analysis; hazard management; income; storm surge; vulnerability","","","","","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Coast and Island Management Technology, Fujian Institute of Oceanology, (FJCIMTS2022-05)","This study is acknowledged by the financial support from Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Coast and Island Management Technology, Fujian Institute of Oceanology (grant No. FJCIMTS 2022-05).

Given the focus of institutions and regulators' attention on climate change and the need to reduce emissions and guide the economy towards a green future, the application of technology to finance can provide an important contribution in the transition towards a more equal and inclusive social context. In this chapter, we investigate how financial technology and fintech companies can facilitate the implementation of the United Nations 2030 agenda and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which require the full inclusion of all actors in the financial system. New technologies can reduce costs while increasing speed and accessibility, enabling more personalized and scalable financial services. In this way, they can allow for easier access to banking services and payment instruments, promoting economic growth and helping to solve a range of social problems such as low employment, poverty, and income inequality in both developed and developing countries. In fact, financial inclusion is not only an objective but also an enabler and accelerator of economic growth. Furthermore, fintech platforms may be able to channel resources into achieving sustainable social goals. The question is, therefore, how financial technology and fintech companies can affect the reduction of social inequalities. By analyzing the most important contributions of scholars on the subject, this study aims to highlight the role that fintech has or could have in the path towards the 2030 social goals and the elimination of inequalities. Finally, we investigate the main critical issues related to low financial literacy, highlighting the need to activate tools complementary to the construction of infrastructures for the effective achievement of financial inclusion objectives. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s),under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

Theoretically, our research is motivated by the fact that if environmental quality is a good with low priority on the hierarchical scale, the effect of inequality on emissions should vary depending on the level of income per capita. In low-income countries, high inequality decreases the demand for brown goods among the poor segment of the population and increases the demand for green goods among richer pioneer consumers, potentially reducing emissions. However, as income rises, a richer median voter will be more likely to approve more stringent environmental policies, and thus, lower inequality becomes beneficial for the environment, and is capable to partially offset the environmental impact of the transition towards a consumption-based society. We test this hypothesis by augmenting a standard EKC equation with the interaction between income per capita and the Gini coefficient. Our results for CO2 and SO2 emissions corroborate our main hypothesis: reducing inequality is beneficial for the environment especially for rich countries. © 2025 The Authors","Climate change; Environmental Kuznets curve; GHG emissions; Inequality; Political economy; Sustainable development goals","Green development; Green economy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Economic growths; Environmental Kuznet's curve; Environmental quality; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Income inequality; Inequality; Per capita; Per capita income; Political economy; climate change; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; income distribution; Kuznets curve; political economy; Sustainable Development Goal; Low emission","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (730403); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","This work was supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, project INNOPATHS [grant number 730403].

It focuses on analyzing the mechanisms of factors such as temperature changes, urban development, green vegetation, energy consumption, and environmental regulation, revealing significant differences in climate adaptation capacities between developed and developing countries. The study finds that moderate warming is beneficial for the sustainable development of cold regions, while high temperatures generally have negative effects across all regions, particularly with more far-reaching impacts in developed countries. Proper urban development and green vegetation management can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of high temperatures, whereas excessive energy consumption exacerbates the negative consequences of climate change. Additionally, socio-economic factors profoundly affect the severity of extreme weather impacts. Low-income and income-inequality countries face greater risks, while in the long term, extreme heat increasingly poses challenges for high-income countries. Climate zone differences exacerbate these impacts, with cold-climate countries experiencing the most severe short-term effects from extreme cold and heat, while in the long term, extreme heat has the greatest impact on tropical countries, and extreme cold continues to affect cold-climate countries, with temperate countries facing moderate effects. Based on the research findings, this paper proposes differentiated climate adaptation strategies and offers policy recommendations in areas such as green infrastructure development, energy transition, environmental regulation, and social security systems to promote the achievement of global climate adaptation and sustainable development goals. It also emphasizes climate justice, ensuring fair participation of vulnerable countries and groups in global climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. © 2025 The Author","Climate adaptation strategy; Climate change; Climate justice; Developed countries; Developing countries; Regional sustainable development","","","","","","","","Abedi S., Moeenian M., Investigating the effects of environmental patents and climate change mitigation technologies on sustainable economic growth in the Middle East, International Journal of Low Carbon Technologies, 16, 3, pp. 910-920, (2021); Abid N., Ahmad F., Aftab J., Razzaq A., A blessing or a burden?

As anthropogenic activities continue to accelerate global environmental degradation, innovative solutions are imperative for mitigating the impacts of climate change and fostering sustainability. However, the effectiveness of these innovations is threatened by global uncertainties and rising income inequalities. Uncertainties in geopolitical landscape and economic disparities may impede the development and widespread adoption of eco-friendly technologies and practices. Given the above background, this study empirically investigates the influences of environmental innovation, world uncertainty and income inequality on renewable energy generation for a balanced panel of 58 countries between 1990 and 2020. The estimated models also control for the effects of globalisation and economic growth. After diagnosing for necessary panel diagnostic tests including cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity, and panel unit-root, the Westerlund cointegration test confirms a significant long-run relationship between the variables of the study. Using panel Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimation, the results reveal that while environmental innovation continues to promote the renewable energy generation, global uncertainty and income inequality hamper it. More importantly, the moderating effects of world uncertainty and income inequality reduce the favourable impact of environmental innovation on renewable energy generation. Besides, economic growth and globalisation continue to play critical roles in speeding up the quest for renewable energy. The PCSE estimation technique confirms the significance of these baseline findings. Potential policy implications are also discussed. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","augmented mean group estimation; energy transition; Environmental innovation; renewable energy; world uncertainty","alternative energy; climate change; economic growth; energy use; globalization; innovation","","","","","","","Adedoyin F.F., Ozturk I., Agboola M.O., Agboola P.O., Bekun F.V., The implications of renewable and non-renewable energy generating in Sub-Saharan Africa: the role of economic policy uncertainties, Energy Policy, 150, pp. 112-115, (2021); Ahir H., Bloom N., Furceri D., World Uncertainty Index (no. w29763), (2022); Ahmed F., Ali I., Kousar S., Ahmed S., The environmental impact of industrialization and foreign direct investment: empirical evidence from Asia-Pacific region, Environ Sci Pollut Res, 29, 20, pp. 1-15, (2022); Allen M., Dube O.P., Solecki W., Aragon-Durand F., Cramer W., Humphreys S., Zickfeld K., Global warming of 1.5 C.

In Europe, consumer-based CO2 consumption per capita fell from 10.8 tons to 7.8 tons between 1990 and 2022, but in Turkey, the same data showed a rise from 4 tons to 5 tons. Strategies to reduce carbon emissions have recently shifted their focus from the production side to the consumption side. However, because different social segments have varying levels of price sensitivity and differing levels of necessity regarding consuming different items, a simple tax policy only targeting the consumption side is doomed to fail. This has prompted a discussion of the factors influencing carbon emissions on the consumption side and how those factors affect the amount of emissions. This study aims to identify the social determinants affecting household carbon emission levels and to demonstrate that such differences play an important role in effective and efficient carbon emission reduction strategies. In this case study, an appropriate testing method was used to test whether there are significant differences in dependent variables (carbon emissions) between categories of independent variables (the social determinants of households). As our literature review demonstrates, the social determinants of households and the local context were found to have an impact on carbon emissions in the case study. Nevertheless, we found that the degree of association lessens when the relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables is re-evaluated while controlling for income level. Consequently, it may be concluded that the primary element influencing carbon emissions is income. In our field study, on the other hand, poverty stood out as another important factor affecting the level of carbon emissions. Poverty affects total household carbon emissions in two different ways, causing both carbon-intensive consumer goods and household appliances with low energy efficiency to be preferred because they are cheap to purchase. Therefore, the fight against poverty should be recognized as an important component of carbon reduction policies in Turkey, and the issue of environmental justice should not be ignored, because we know that 30% of the population was living in poverty (compared to the other 70% receiving the national median income) in 2022. © 2024 by the authors.","climate change mitigation policies; household characteristics; household CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; income inequality; Turkey","Mersin; carbon emission; consumption behavior; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental justice; mitigation; pollution policy; poverty; strategic approach; tax system","","","","","","","Fujii M., Fujita T., Dong L., Lu C., Geng Y., Behera S.K., Park H.-S., Chiu A.S.F., Possibility of developing low-carbon industries through urban symbiosis in Asian cities, J.

Using an empirical analysis of 30 provinces in China, we examine how the pace of multi-dimension energy transition influences urban-rural income gap. It starts from an assessment of China's energy transition performance by constructing a comprehensive index framework. Then we investigate the impacts of the energy transition on the urban-rural income gap by employing panel data of China's 30 provinces from 2008 to 2019. Our results demonstrate a significant upward trend in China's overall energy transition performance. Meanwhile, this paper highlights the positive but heterogenous contributions of the energy transition to narrowing the urban-rural income gap. We also gauge the positive moderating effects of energy transition and various targeted transition policies and environmental factors on the urban-rural income gap in China, such as the clean heating and PV-based poverty alleviation project; but the negative effect of coal phaseout policy cannot be ignored. Our findings in the context of urban-rural income inequality in China provide practical insights and pertinent policy implications to deepen understanding of the global just energy transition. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Energy transition; Just transition; Regional inequality; Urban-rural income gap","China; Energy policy; Empirical analysis; Energy transitions; Global society; Just transition; Multi dimensions; Performance; Regional inequality; Social justice; Urban-rural; Urban-rural income gap; alternative energy; climate change; energy policy; energy resource; environmental factor; income distribution; performance assessment; rural area; social justice; targeting; urban area; Climate change","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71934007, 72243012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (22&ZD106); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","The authors are grateful to the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 71934007 & 72243012 ) and the National Social Science Fund of China ( 22&ZD106 ).","Acheampong A.O., Dzator J., Shahbaz M., Empowering the powerless: does access to energy improve income inequality?, Energy Econ., 99, (2021); Ang B.W., Is the energy intensity a less useful indicator than the carbon factor in the study of climate change?, Energy Pol., 27, 15, pp. 943-946, (1999); Antimiani A., Costantini V., Kuik O., Paglialunga E., Mitigation of adverse effects on competitiveness and leakage of unilateral EU climate policy: an assessment of policy instruments, Ecol.

This transition is crucial for solving the climate issue and building a more sustainable future. Therefore, within the loaded capacity curve (LCC) theory framework, this study investigates the effects of digital adaptation, energy transition, export diversification, and income inequality on the load capacity factor (LCF). This study also attempts to investigate the integration effects of digital adaptation and energy transition, and digital adaptation and export diversification, on LCF. Furthermore, we explored how income inequality influences the LCF in economies. For this study, 112 countries were selected based on the data availability. Panel data from 2010 to 2021 were analyzed using the STATA software 13 application utilizing a two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. First, interestingly, our finding shows that digital adaptation and income significantly affect the LCF. An increase in income increases the LCF among the middle-income group of countries. Therefore, LCC is confirmed in this research. Surprisingly, energy transition, export diversification, and foreign direct investment negatively impact the LCF in the base model. Second, the impact of integrating digital adaptation and energy transition has a positive effect on LCF. Third, a negative correlation was observed between the interaction of export diversification and digital adaptation with the LCF. Fourth, a positive correlation was observed between the interaction of renewable energy and digital adaptation with the LCF. Finally, this study explores the impact of the energy transition, export diversification, and income inequality on the LCF with reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The result shows a negative effect between export diversification and LCF among OPECs at a 10% significance level. To improve the quality of our planet, policymakers must understand the forces causing climate change. By adopting a comprehensive perspective, the study aims to understand how these interrelated factors collaboratively influence the LCF thoroughly. Additionally, this research seeks to provide valuable insights related to energy transition, digital adaptation, and export diversification to policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders regarding possible avenues for cultivating a more joyful and sustainable global community. © 2024 by the authors.","digital adaptation; energy transition; export diversification; income inequality; LCF; OPEC","Capacity curves; Capacity factors; Digital adaptation; Energy transitions; Export diversification; Income inequality; Load capacity; Load capacity factor; Organization of Petroleum Ex-porting Countries; Policy makers","","","","","Deanship of Scientific Research, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, DSR, (FRP-1444-28); Deanship of Scientific Research, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, DSR","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University through the Research Funding Program, Grant No. FRP-1444-28.

Here I apply a Bayesian decision framework to interpret the role of motivated reasoning during forecasting and assess some of the ensuing predictions. In 2 online studies, for each of a set of potential risky social events (e.g., economic crisis, rise of income inequality, and increase in violent crime), participants expressed judgments about the probability that the event will occur, how negative occurrence of the event would be, whether society is able to intervene in the event. Supporting predictions of the Bayesian decision model, the analyses revealed that participants who deemed the events as more probable also assessed occurrence of the events as more negative and believed society to be more capable to intervene in the events. Supporting the notion that a social threat is appraised as more probable when an intervention is deemed to be possible, these findings are compatible with a form of intervention bias. These observations are relevant for campaigns aimed at informing the population about potential social risks such as climate change, economic dislocations, and pandemics. © 2024 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.","Bayesian; decision; forecasting; intervention bias; motivated reasoning; risk","","","","","","","","Baumeister R.

This has polarised the CAP policy debate, and erroneously pushes for a choice between prioritising either climate action or food security. Recent developments, including the war in Ukraine, added to concerns about uncertain and volatile future price prospects. Food price prospects and population growth impacts are pivotal in the debate about food security as higher food costs, prospects for higher energy costs driven by the green transition and increasing income inequalities put households in both developed and the developing world at risk with respect to food affordability. Adding trends of global population growth, especially in Africa, creates a clear challenge of availability in certain products and regions. The EU's underestimated and misunderstood record of producing more with less could help EU agriculture to positively contribute to addressing both food security and climate change.

In Malaysia, food security is increasingly threatened due to reliance on imports, declining agricultural productivity, and income inequality. In 2023, food imports reached RM78.7 billion, indicating heavy dependence on global markets. Population growth, expected to reach 42 million by 2050, exacerbates the demand for food, creating further stress on the nation's food systems. This study employed a qualitative methodology to analyze factors impacting Malaysia's food security, focusing on secondary data from academic and institutional sources. Document analysis was used to examine existing policies and data on food security and its implications. Key findings highlight that food insecurity in Malaysia leads to hunger, malnutrition, and related health issues, such as childhood stunting and obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly worsened these conditions, with 30% of the population estimated to experience food insecurity. Environmental factors, including climate change, deforestation, and resource overuse, further challenge food production. Additionally, global disruptions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have escalated costs and strained supply chains. The study concludes that addressing Malaysia's food security requires a holistic approach, integrating sustainable agricultural practices, reducing dependency on imports, and strengthening local food systems. Collaborative efforts between governments, private sectors, and international organizations are essential to ensure an equitable and sustainable food future. This research underscores the urgent need for policy reforms and strategic planning to safeguard Malaysia's food security amidst growing global and local challenges. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

This study delves into the intricate relation between climate vulnerability and green innovation, utilizing panel data from 131 nations from 1995 to 2019. Our empirical analysis reveals that climate vulnerability significantly hinders green innovation. We further dissect the influence of various sub-sectoral dimensions of climate vulnerability, identifying that ecosystems, food, infrastructure, and water are vital contributors to green innovation. At the same time, habitat and health sectors are detrimental to it. Additionally, we examine the influence of economic and globalization heterogeneity, finding that climate vulnerability adversely impacts green innovation in non-OECD and low-to middle-income countries, with less pronounced effects in nations with higher economic sophistication. Notably, climate vulnerability poses a more significant barrier to green innovation in countries with lower globalization. Our research also indicates that corruption control and political stability can ameliorate the adverse consequences of climate vulnerability on green innovation. In contrast, income inequality and increased greenhouse gas emissions intensify these adverse impacts. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting novel cross-country evidence on the factors influencing green innovation, with a focus on the effect of climate vulnerability. © 2024 The Authors","Climate vulnerability; Green innovation; Two-way fixed effects model","","","","","","","","Acevedo S., Mrkaic M., Novta N., Pugacheva E., Topalova P., The effects of weather shocks on economic activity: What are the channels of impact?, 65, (2020); Al Mamun A., Islam A.R.M.T., Alam G.M.M., Sarker M.N.I., Erdiaw-Kwasie M.O., Bhandari H., Mallick J., Livelihood vulnerability of char land communities to climate change and natural hazards in Bangladesh: An application of livelihood vulnerability index, 115, (2023); Albaker A., Abbasi K.R., Haddad A.M., Radulescu M., Manescu C., Bondac G.T., Analyzing the impact of renewable energy and green innovation on carbon emissions in the MENA region, 16, (2023); Batten S., Sowerbutts R., Tanaka M., Climate change: Macroeconomic impact and implications for monetary policy, (2020); Chen X., Fu Q., Chang C.P., What are the shocks of climate change on clean energy investment: A diversified exploration, 95, (2021); Chen Z., Hao X., Chen F., Green innovation and enterprise reputation value, 32, (2023); Chen R., Ramzan M., Hafeez M., Ullah S., Green innovation-green growth nexus in BRICS: Does financial globalization matter?, 8, (2023); Donadelli M., Juppner M., Riedel M., Schlag C., Temperature shocks and welfare costs, 82, (2017); Edler J., Fagerberg J., Innovation policy: What, why, and how, 33, (2017); Feindouno S., Guillaumont P., Simonet C., The physical vulnerability to climate change index: An index to Be used for international policy, 176, (2020); Freitas J.S., Melo J.C.

Many African countries have suffered the repercussions of environmental and climate deterioration, most notably internal displacement. This article sought to examine the impact of climate change within the context of internal displacement in Africa and to preview and describe the trends of internally displaced people in Africa. The study used a mixed methods approach. Qualitative data was obtained from online repositories, and it was analyzed using content analysis. Quantitative data was obtained from World Bank portal and it was analysed using descriptive statistics. Research findings have shown that Africa is plagued by a high number of internally displaced people. It was also established that climate change leads to income inequality, the exposure of people to poverty, and the destruction of infrastructure. These adverse effects affect the capacity of African economies to attain selected Sustainable Development Goals. In terms of policy recommendations, it was suggested that there is a need to strengthen the regional and continental bodies, invest in climate change adaptation measures, broaden the definition of refugees to include climate refugees, and promote robust research and capacity building. © The Author(s) 2024.","Climate change;

Accordingly, territories differ in terms of exposure to climate events, of capacity to adopt climate mitigation policies and of the welfare effects that these deep transformations entail. The paper brings together these threads with an empirical study of the relationship between green technology development and income inequality in US metropolitan areas over the period 2005–15. We find a positive association between local patenting capacity and growing income gaps to the detriment of the least affluent. Further, higher patenting propensity in early-stage technologies has a stronger association with income inequality, whereas such a relationship dissipates at later stages of the life cycle. © 2023 Regional Studies Association.","environmental technologies; inequality; technology life cycle","United States; empirical analysis; environmental technology; income distribution; life cycle analysis; metropolitan area; technological development","","","","","PRTR; European Union fund NextGenerationEU; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MCIN, (PID2020-119096RB-I00/MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MCIN","Davide Consoli: Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00F3n (PID2020-119096RB-I00/MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033).

This paper examines the role of access to clean cooking fuels in promoting income growth and reducing income inequality. Using data from Chinese households, we show that a 10% increase in the adoption of clean cooking fuels would result in an increase in total annual household income of US$37 billion nationwide. Income growth from access to clean cooking fuels is greater for lower-income groups due to a shift to higher household income and reduced downward household income mobility, which contributes to a reduction in income inequality. The effect of access to clean cooking fuels on household income growth is primarily driven by improved health and increased labor supply. The use of clean cooking fuels also saves fuel collection time and cooking time, reducing time spent on household chores by about 0.4 h per day, thereby increasing labor supply in the job market and improving wage income. Improvements in income due to clean cooking fuels are influenced by external conditions, urbanization, education, employment opportunities, and good market conditions. With further promotion of clean cooking fuels, household income and inequality in China are expected to improve further by 2030 and contribute more widely to human well-being and achievement of the SDGs.

While it is correct that innovation policy, at least until recently, has given higher priority to economic growth than to global challenges such as climate change and income inequality this is in no way immanent in the innovation system concept. To illustrate, the author introduces concepts and perspectives related to the innovation system approach which are particularly useful, when it comes to develop innovation policies aiming at system transformation. It is concluded that there is a need to combine different theoretical framings as inspiration for transformative innovation policy. In addition, all framings need to have a double focus on climate change and global income inequality, and they need to go beyond national perspectives and consider policies aiming at system transformation at the global level. While the paper refers to empirical illustrations it is principally conceptual. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; income inequality; Innovation system; learning economy; sustainable development goals; transformative innovation policy","","","","","","","","Altenburg T., Pegels A., Sustainability-Oriented Innovation Systems–Managing the Green Transformation, Innovation and Development, 2, 1, pp. 5-22, (2012); Andersen A.D., Johnson B.H., Marin A., Kaplan D., Stubrin L., Lundvall B.-A., Kaplinsky R., Natural Resources, Innovation and Development, (2015); Arocena R., Sutz J., Research and Innovation Policies for Social Inclusion: An Opportunity for Developing Countries, Innovation and Development, 2, 1, pp. 147-158, (2012); Arrow K., The Limits of Organization, (1974); Bergek A., Jacobsson S., Carlsson B., Lindmark S., Rickne A., Analyzing the Functional Dynamics of Technological Innovation Systems: A Scheme of Analysis, Research Policy, 37, 3, pp. 407-429, (2008); Boyce J., Rosset P., Stanton E., ‘Land Reform and Sustainable Development’, WP#98.

We identify the 50 most influential publications in the field that have evolved into three distinct categories, each of which we critically review to identify the main contributions of this research area. Design/methodology/approach: By conducting a state-of-the-art literature review, this paper identifies the most influential papers in the research fields on the welfare impact of financial inclusion. One caveat is that as newer publications generally have fewer citations, reviewing prior work can result in a misleading account of emerging trends and research directions. Manual assessment of publications after 2018 facilitates a discussion of important emerging research trends and their directions. Findings: The three key research streams are identified as financial services and financial accessibility, financial capability, and financial literacy and household welfare. By assessing publications from 2018 to 2023, we also document four key emerging research trends: Fintech and digital financial inclusion, sustainability and climate change, growth, poverty, income inequality, financial stability, and Entrepreneurship. Drawing on these emerging trends, we highlight the opportunities for future research. Research limitations/implications: Keyword searches have limitations as some papers might be overlooked if they do not match the specific search criteria, despite their relation and significance to the overall topic of the welfare impact of financial inclusion. To address this issue, we have expanded this review by incorporating more literature from other databases, such as the Scopus database which may alleviate this issue. Practical implications: The three key research streams contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the welfare impact of financial inclusion. The emerging trends integrate existing knowledge and leave the chance for innovative research to expand the research frontier. Originality/value: This paper fulfils the systematic literature review streams in the welfare impact of financial inclusion and provides fruitful opportunities for future research. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Financial accessibility;

While considerable attention has been given to its impact on financial stability and economic productivity, there is limited focus on its effects on income inequality. We introduce a unique criterion for sample selection. We aim to provide an empirical analysis of how climate change impacts income inequality in 43 most climate-vulnerable countries, 39 most unequal countries in terms of income distribution, and India separately (1971–2021). We select the most vulnerable countries to investigate the magnitude of income inequality caused by climate change. Given that climate hazards enhance inequality in countries with prevailing socioeconomic inequalities, we choose unequal countries to investigate whether climate change is a significant determinant of their existing condition. We also analyse the relationship for India because India is one of the most climate-vulnerable and unequal countries. We use three climate change indices—vulnerability to climate change, annual surface temperature change, and frequency of climate-related disasters—to check the effects of particular aspects of climate change. We deploy a standard panel regression analysis followed by a series of robustness checks and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach to analyse the link for India. We find that climate change has adverse impacts in both groups and in India, both in the long and short term. Our findings suggest that policymakers in developing countries may need to equally place importance on developmental and climate change abatement goals as well as expedite their environmental targets. © The Author(s) 2024.","ARDL Bounds Test; Climate change; Fixed effects regressions; Income inequality; India; Panel data","","","","","","","","Abdullah A.N., Mohammad K.K., Zander B.M., Stacey N., Garnett S.T., A short-term decrease in household income inequality in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh, following cyclone Aila, Nat Hazards, 83, 2, pp. 1103-1123, (2016); Aggarwal R., Impacts of climate shocks on household consumption and inequality in India, Environ Dev Econ, 26, 5-6, pp. 488-511, (2021); Alam I., Quazi R., Determinants of capital flight: an econometric case study of Bangladesh, Int Rev Appl Econ, 17, 1, pp. 85-103, (2003); Ali I.M.A., Income inequality and environmental degradation in egypt: evidence from dynamic ARDL approach, Environ Sci Pollut Res, 29, 6, pp. 8408-8422, (2022); Asamoah L.A., Institutional quality and income inequality in developing countries: a dynamic panel threshold analysis, Prog Dev Stud, 21, 2, pp. 123-143, (2021); Baek I., Shi Q., Impact of economic globalization on income inequality: developed economies vs emerging economies, Glob Econ J, 16, 1, pp. 49-61, (2016); Benos N., Tsiachtsiras G., Innovation and income inequality: world evidence, MPRA Paper No, (2019); Berisha E., Dubey R.S., Gharehgozli O., Inflation and income inequality: does the level of income inequality matter?, SSRN Electron J, (2023); Bhagwati J., In defense of globalization, (2004); Birkmann J., Jamshed A., McMillan J.M., Feldmeyer D., Totin E., Solecki W., Ibrahim Z.Z., Roberts D., Kerr R.B., Poertner H.-O., Pelling M., Djalante R., Garschagen M., Filho W.L., Guha-Sapir D., Alegria A., Understanding human vulnerability to climate change: a global perspective on index validation for adaptation planning, Sci Total Environ, 803, (2022); Bui A.T., Dungey M., Nguyen C.V., Pham T.P., The impact of natural disasters on household income, expenditure, poverty and inequality: evidence from Vietnam, Appl Econ, 46, 15, pp. 1751-1766, (2014); Cevik S., Jalles J.T., For whom the bell tolls: climate change and income inequality, Energy Policy, 174, (2023); Chisadza C., Clance M., Sheng X., Gupta R., Climate change and inequality: evidence from the United States, Sustainability, 15, 6, (2023); Dang H.H., Nguyen M.C., Trinh T.A., Does hotter temperature increase poverty and inequality?

This paper investigates the impact of climate change on income inequality, and the role of renewable energy in moderating this impact for a panel data set of 36 Asian countries over the period of 1990–2021. Results from panel data analysis techniques show that climate change exacerbates the income inequality while renewable energy not only reduces income inequality but also lessens the detrimental impact of climate change on income equality through the channels of job creation and access to renewable energy. Remarkably, the role of renewable energy becomes stronger in those countries that are more exposed to climate change. The findings are robust with different estimation methods as well as various proxies of climate change and income inequality. These results highlight the critical role of renewable energy policies in promoting both environmental sustainability and socioeconomic equity. Through this paper, we aim to provide invaluable insights that can aid policymakers in making informed decisions to advance a future marked by sustainability, equity, and resilience. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Asian countries; Climate change; Income inequality; Renewable energy","Asia; Energy policy; Sustainable development; Alternative energy source; Asian countries; Data analysis techniques; Data set; Income inequality; Job creation; Panel data; Panel data analysis; Policy makers; Renewable energies; alternative energy; climate change; climate effect; energy policy; energy resource; income distribution; socioeconomic impact; sustainability; Climate change","","","","","National Foundation for Science and Technology Development, NAFOSTED; NAFOSTED, (502.01-2021.48)","This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.01-2021.48.

However, its distributional implications have received little attention. This paper attempts to fill this gap by investigating if climate shocks affect income inequality. Using a Vector Autoregression for a large cross-country panel, we identify the climate shock in the frequency domain as the shock that explains the bulk of the variance of climate variables in the long-run. An adverse climate shock is associated with an increase in measures of income inequality, affecting mostly low income households. The impact of the shock is larger in magnitude for low income, hot countries with a significant agricultural sector and low degree of adaptation to climate change. © 2024 The Author(s)","Climate shock; Economic growth; Frequency domain identification; Income inequality; Panel VAR","climate change; economic growth; empirical analysis; income distribution; low income population; vector autoregression","","","","","","","Acevedo S., Mrkaic M., Novta N., Pugacheva E., Topalova P., The effects of weather shocks on economic activity: What are the channels of impact?, J.

Although its consequences are harmful to all humanity, some regions across the world remain more vulnerable than others. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most suffering regions. In this paper, we investigate the climate change-income inequality nexus in a panel of sub-Saharan countries over the period 1990–2019. A greater emphasis is put on the potential transmission channels that drive this relationship. By using the recently developed method of moments quantile regression, we find that income inequality is exacerbated by the vulnerability to climate change. This relationship is still robust across all the quantiles with a greater effect at the highest quantile. The empirical findings reveal also the moderating role of agriculture, education, and gender through which the effect of climate change on income inequality is channeled. In light of the outcomes, the sub-Saharan African region still needs appropriate combined mitigation and adaptation measures to efficiently combat the adverse effects of climate change. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate change; income inequality; method of moments quantile regression (MMQR); sub-Saharan Africa","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J.A., Yared P., Income and democracy, American Economic Review, 98, 3, pp. 808-842, (2008); Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A., Rents and economic development: The perspective of why nations fail, Public Choice, 181, 1, pp. 13-28, (2019); Acheampong A.O., Dzator J., Abunyewah M., Erdiaw-Kwasie M.O., Opoku E.E.O., Sub-Saharan Africa's tragedy: Resource curse, democracy and income inequality, Social Indicators Research, 168, pp. 471-509, (2023); Alderson A.S., Nielsen F., Income inequality, development, and dependence: A reconsideration, American Sociological Review, 64, 4, pp. 606-631, (1999); Andrijevic M., Crespo Cuaresma J., Lissner T., Thomas A., Schleussner C.F., Overcoming gender inequality for climate resilient development, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Autor D.H., Katz L.F., Krueger A.B., Computing inequality: Have computers changed the labor market?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 113, pp. 1169-1213, (1998); Becker G., Investment in Human Capital: A theoretical analysis, Journal of Political Economy, 70, pp. 9-49, (1962); Binder M., Coad A., From average Joe's happiness to miserable Jane and Cheerful John: Using quantile regressions to analyze the full subjective well- being distribution, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 79, 3, pp. 275-290, (2011); Bohra-Mishra P., Oppenheimer M., Hsiang S.M., Nonlinear permanent migration response to climatic variations but minimal response to disasters, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 27, pp. 9780-9785, (2014); Burke M., Hsiang S.M., Miguel E., Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production, Nature, 527, 7577, pp. 235-239, (2015); Cappelli F., Costantini V., Consoli D., The trap of climate change-induced “natural” disasters and inequality, Global Environmental Change, 70, (2021); Cevik S., Jalles J.T., For whom the bell tolls: Climate change and income inequality, Energy Policy, 174, (2023); Chancel L., Cogneau D., Gethin A., Myczkowski A., Robilliard A.S., Income inequality in Africa, 1990–2019: Measurement, patterns, determinants, World Development, 163, (2023); Cosbey A., Climate policies, economic diversification and trade (SSRN scholarly paper 3135359), (2017); Diao X., Hazell P., Kolavalli S., Resnick D., Ghana's economic and agricultural transformation: Past performance and future prospects, (2019); Diffenbaugh N.S., Burke M., Global warming has increased global economic inequality, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116, 20, pp. 9808-9813, (2019); Dollar D., Kraay A., Growth is good for the poor, Journal of Economic Growth, 7, pp. 195-225, (2002); Feenstra R., Hanson G., Foreign direct investment and relative wages: Evidence from Mexico's maquiladoras, Journal of International Economics, 42, 3-4, pp. 371-393, (1997); Gill A.R., Hassan S., Viswanathan K.K., Is democracy enough to get early turn of the environmental Kuznets curve in ASEAN countries?, Energy and Environment, 30, 8, pp. 1491-1505, (2019); Hallegatte S., Fay M., Barbier E.B., Poverty and climate change: Introduction, Environment and Development Economics, 23, 3, pp. 217-233, (2018); Hartmann D., Bezerra M., Lodolo B., Pinheiro F.L., International trade, development traps, and the core-periphery structure of income inequality, Economia, 21, 2, pp. 255-278, (2020); Herzer D., Nunnenkamp P., Inward and outward FDI and income inequality: Evidence from Europe, Review of World Economics, 149, 2, pp. 395-422, (2013); Ike G.N., Usman O., Sarkodie S.A., Testing the role of oil production in the environmental Kuznets curve of oil producing countries: New insights from method of moments quantile regression, Science of the Total Environment, 711, (2020); Adapting to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa, Regional economic outlook, April 2020, sub-Saharan Africa.

Drawing from panel data from 53 countries between 2000 and 2021, the study explores key determinants of income inequality, including GDP per capita, employment structure, access to electricity, renewable energy consumption, and natural resource rents. The findings reveal that economic growth and employment in services significantly reduce income inequality in high-income countries, while access to electricity and renewable energy present more complex effects, sometimes widening inequality. In middle-income countries, improving energy infrastructure and fostering economic growth are critical for reducing inequality, though reliance on natural resources and trade may have adverse effects. The results highlight the need for tailored policy interventions: high-income countries must focus on equitable energy access and managing globalization’s effects on inequality, while middle-income countries should prioritize expanding energy infrastructure and sustainably managing natural resource revenues to ensure inclusive growth. The study’s insights into the role of renewable energy in addressing inequality provide a foundation for future research, particularly in exploring how energy transition policies can be designed to promote both environmental sustainability and social equity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Climate change; Elastic net; Income Inequality; Lasso; Panel; Ridge","Energy economics; Economic growths; Elastic net; Energy infrastructures; Income inequality; Lasso; Middle-income countries; Panel; Regression techniques; Renewable energies; Ridge; Clean energy","","","","","Center of Excellence in Econometrics, Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University, CMU","The authors thank the \u201CCenter of Excellence in Econometrics, Chiang Mai University\u201D for its financial support.

Therefore, nature warns societies to limit emissions and live eco-friendly due to rising temperatures and abrupt climate change. The regional comprehensive economic cooperation (RCEP), the world’s foremost trading union, represents nearly one-third of the global economy and population and accounts for 30% of global trade and gross domestic product. This study observed the RECP economies from 1990 to 2021 to determine the connection between income inequality, risk components, renewable energy (RE), information communication, and technology (ICT) on environmental sustainability. However, limited research has investigated the association between such factors and ecology. To fill this gap, our research makes a unique contribution by exploring four specific econometric models to examine composite risk, financial risk, economic risk, political risk, and income inequality. The empirical study includes cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity, augmented panel unit root test, Westerlund cointegration, second-generation cross-section augmented autoregressive distributed lags, and panel causality test. In addition, the augmented mean group estimation is used as a robustness check. The short-run findings demonstrate that an increase of 1% in income inequality and the utilization of RE significantly decrease (0.1786%) and (0.2024%) CO2 emissions. In the long run, the income inequality coefficient (− 0.4316) and the utilization of RE coefficient (− 0.9085) states that increasing income inequality and the utilization of RE by 1% reduces CO2 emissions in the environment by (0.4316%) and (0.9085%). Moreover, the risk components and ICT positively affect CO2 emissions and deteriorate environmental quality. The study concludes that in RECP economies, governments and regulators should prioritize preserving stable income inequality and incentivizing businesses to use renewable energy sources. These nations require stringent environmental regulations, governmental stability, robust institutions, and effective law enforcement to reduce CO2 emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Environmental sustainability; ICT; Income inequality; Renewable energy; Risk components","","","","","","","","Abdul D., Wenqi J., Tanveer A., Environmental stewardship: Analyzing the dynamic impact of renewable energy, foreign remittances, and globalization index on China’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, Renewable Energy, 201, pp. 418-425, (2022); Adebayo T.S., Kartal M.T., Aga M., Al-Faryan M.A.S., Role of country risks and renewable energy consumption on environmental quality: Evidence from MINT countries, Journal of Environmental Management, (2023); Adebayo T.S., Kirikkaleli D., Impact of renewable energy consumption, globalization, and technological innovation on environmental degradation in Japan: Application of wavelet tools, Environment, Development and Sustainability, (2021); Adebayo T.S., Ozkan O., Investigating the influence of socioeconomic conditions, renewable energy and eco-innovation on environmental degradation in the United States: A wavelet quantile-based analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 434, (2024); Adebayo T.S., Ozkan O., Evaluating the role of financial globalization and oil consumption on ecological quality: A new perspective from quantile-on-quantile granger causality, Heliyon, (2024); Adebayo T.S., Saeed Meo M., Eweade B.S., Ozkan O., Examining the effects of solar energy Innovations, information and communication technology and financial globalization on environmental quality in the united States via Quantile-On-Quantile KRLS analysis, Solar Energy, (2024); Adebayo T.S., Ullah S., Kartal M.T., Ali K., Pata U.K., Aga M., Endorsing sustainable development in BRICS: The role of technological innovation, renewable energy consumption, and natural resources in limiting carbon emission, Science of the Total Environment, (2023); Afeltra G., Alerasoul S.A., Strozzi F., The evolution of sustainable innovation: From the past to the future, European Journal of Innovation Management, 26, pp. 386-421, (2023); Ahmad W., Ullah S., Ozturk I., Majeed M.T., Does inflation instability affect environmental pollution?

Using the data of 273 cities in China from 2001 to 2019, this research evaluates the impact of climate change on urban inclusive economic growth by constructing a temperature bin variable according to the daily average temperature. It is found that with the temperature bin [18 °C, 21 °C) as the benchmark group, both temperature rise and fall have a negative influence on inclusive economic growth. Notably, the adverse effects of high temperatures (above 27 °C) are statistically and economically significant, exhibiting a trend of increasing magnitude. The mechanism test shows that high temperature affects the inclusive growth level of the urban economy mainly by exacerbating the urban‒rural income gap. The heterogeneity analysis found that cities located in hot regions, southern regions or coastal areas are more sensitive to high temperatures and experience more prominent effects. This research holds significant practical implications for China to achieve a win‒win situation of balanced economic development and climate governance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate governance; Income disparity; Urban inclusive economic growth","China; Cities; Climate Change; Economic Development; Humans; China; placebo; Adverse effect; Climate governance; Economic growths; Heating up; Highest temperature; Income disparity; Temperature rise; Urban chinas; Urban economy; Urban inclusive economic growth; climate change; economic development; economic growth; environmental policy; high temperature; urban economy; Article; benchmarking; China; climate change; climate warming; controlled study; economic aspect; economic development; global climate; greenhouse effect; high temperature; human; income; income distribution; income inequality; low temperature; seashore; temperature; urban area; urban population; China; city","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (22ZDA107); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China (22ZDA107).

Domestic income inequality is linked to nations' carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through multiple theorized pathways. Using a multidimensional framework, multiregional input-output analysis, panel regression analysis, and a sample of 34 high-income nations from 2004 to 2015, I investigate the relationships between nations' income inequality and four components of CO2 emissions with distinct implications for climate change mitigation: (1) emissions generated by domestic-oriented supply chain activities; (2) emissions embodied in exports; (3) direct emissions from end-user activities; and (4) emissions embodied in imports. I theorize that income inequality is heterogeneously related to the four emission components via different pathways. Results show that the relationships vary across emission components, change over time, and differ between inequality measures. The Gini coefficient is generally less influential on CO2 emissions than the income share of the top 10%. Notably, the income share of the top 10% is negatively related to direct end-user emissions from 2009 to 2011 and positively related to emissions in exports from 2011 to 2015, indicating variations in pathways both across emission components and over time - especially during and after the Great Recession. The findings underscore the multidimensionality in the income inequality-CO2 emissions relationship. Whether reducing income inequality can generate the co-benefit of emission abatement while avoiding a potential trade-off is a context-specific question that requires careful policy design and implementation. © 2024 The Author(s).

The harsh weather conditions and extreme climates in the NWT magnify the challenges associated with maintaining infrastructure, often undermining its long-term benefits. I find that the disruptions in ice roads, which serve as vital links for northern Canadian communities, exacerbate income inequality by placing a greater burden on low-income households while disproportionately favoring higher-income groups. Education is a critical factor in driving income growth and reducing inequality. Conversely, reliance on social assistance notably reduces income for higher-income families, while it provides a boost for those in need. Larger communities, however, experience more severe economic challenges, especially within lower-income groups. © 2025 The Author","Canada; Climate Change; Ice Roads; Income; Infrastructure; Northwest Territories; Remote Communities; Transportation","","","","","","","","Adjei E., Ahmed F., Zapata O., Poelzer G., Distributional effects of the ice road–climate nexus and their economic implications, Working Paper., (2025); Ahmed F., Ahmed R., Poelzer G., Poelzer G., Soderberg C., Zapata O., Guilmette E., Exploring Energy Transition Narratives through Mayoral Insights using Artificial Intelligence, (2025); Ahmed F., Poelzer G.; Ahmed F., Hall S., (2025); Ahmed F., Poelzer G., Noble B., Meaningful Participation and Energy Transitions in the North, (2024); Ahmed F., Zapata O., Poelzer G., Sustainability in the arctic: A bibliometric analysis, Discover Sustainability, 5, 1, (2024); Amber C., Agrawal S., Zoe C., Just transition in the northwest territories: Insights and values from indigenous and non-indigenous northerners, Heliyon, 9, 8, (2023); Dong Y., Xiao P., Zhang X., Ge D., Yu J., Chen Y., Bai J., Increased vulnerability of Arctic potential ice roads under climate change, Communications Earth & Environment, 6, 1, (2025); Aschauer D.A., Highway capacity and economic growth, Economic Perspectives, 14, 5, pp. 4-24, (1990); Asher S., Novosad P., Rural roads and local economic development, American Economic Review, 110, 3, pp. 797-823, (2020); Banerjee A., Somanathan R., The political economy of public goods: Some evidence from India, Journal of development Economics, 82, 2, pp. 287-314, (2007); Banerjee A., Duflo E., Qian N., On the road: Access to transportation infrastructure and economic growth in China, Journal of Development Economics, 145, (2020); Barrette P.D., The Canadian winter road infrastructure and climate change adaptation: Prospective solutions through R&D Ocean, Coastal and River Engineering, (2018); Barrette P.D., Hori Y., Kim A.M., The Canadian winter road infrastructure in a warming climate: Toward resiliency assessment and resource prioritization, Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, 7, 6, pp. 842-860, (2022); Becker G.S., Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis with Special Reference to Education, (1993); Berman M., Community-Based Monitoring of Traditional Knowledge, (2014); Berman M., Schmidt J.I., Economic effects of climate change in Alaska, Weather, Climate, and Society, 11, 2, pp. 245-258, (2019); Bitler M., Hoynes H., Kuka E., Child poverty, the great recession, and the social safety net in the United States, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 36, 2, pp. 358-389, (2017); Burke M., Hsiang S.M., Miguel E., Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production, Nature, 527, 7577, pp. 235-239, (2015); Cachon G.P., Gallino S., Olivares M., (2012); Calderon C., Chong A., Volume and quality of infrastructure and the distribution of income: An empirical investigation, Review of Income and Wealth, 50, 1, pp. 87-106, (2004); Card D., The Causal Effect of Education on Earnings, Handbook of Labor Economics, 3, pp. 1801-1863, (1999); Chanieabate M., He H., Guo C., Abrahamgeremew B., Huang Y., Examining the relationship between transportation infrastructure, urbanization level and rural-urban income gap in China, Sustainability, 15, 10, (2023); Colella F., Lalive R., Sakalli S.O., Thoenig M., (2019); Colella F., Lalive R., Sakalli S.O., Thoenig M., acreg: Arbitrary correlation regression, The Stata Journal, 23, 1, pp. 119-147, (2023); Conley T.G., Kelly M., The standard errors of persistence, Journal of International Economics, 153, (2025); Dalgaard C.J., Kaarsen N., Olsson O., Selaya P., Roman roads to prosperity: Persistence and non-persistence of public infrastructure, Journal of Comparative Economics, 50, 4, pp. 896-916, (2022); Dell M., Jones B.F., Olken B.A., Temperature shocks and economic growth: Evidence from the last half century, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 4, 3, pp. 66-95, (2012); Dercon S., Gilligan D.O., Hoddinott J., Woldehanna T., The impact of agricultural extension and roads on poverty and consumption growth in fifteen Ethiopian villages, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 91, 4, pp. 1007-1021, (2009); Deschenes O., Greenstone M., The economic impacts of climate change: evidence from agricultural output and random fluctuations in weather, American economic review, 97, 1, pp. 354-385, (2007); Donaldson D., Railroads of the Raj: Estimating the impact of transportation infrastructure, American Economic Review, 108, 4-5, pp. 899-934, (2018); Duhaime G., (2008); Dumas C., Jativa X., Better roads, better off?

Such impacts are especially important at subnational levels, but projections of income distributions at these levels are scarce. Here, we project U.S. state-level income distributions for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). We apply a non-parametric approach, specifically a recently developed principal components algorithm to generate net income distributions for deciles across 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We produce these projections to 2100 for three SSP scenarios in combination with varying projections of GDP per capita to represent a wide range of possible futures and uncertainties. In the generation of these scenarios, we also generated tax adjusted historical deciles by U.S. states, which we used for validating model performance. Our method thus produces income distributions by decile for each state, reflecting the variability in state income, population, and tax regimes. Our net income projections by decile can be used in both emissions- and impact-related research to understand distributional effects at various income levels and identify economically vulnerable populations. © 2023 Battelle Memorial Institute.

Competing with such necessarily thin, portmanteau definitions, a systems thinking approach suggests that capitalism is alternately a complex adaptive system itself fully integrated with—if not structural to—global, contemporary human society. As such, it is susceptible to criticism on account of increasing and disparate income inequalities; an array of unaddressed crises in climate change attributed to ‘free’ industrialization; a one-size-fits-all to commercial organizations; as well as institutionalized racism, sexism, multiple additional forms of categorical discrimination, and widespread corruption. In the face of such polemical processes, a question arises as to what is the future of this global capitalism as it spreads throughout the planet? In this paper we discuss three possible scenarios for the future of global political economies. We imagine: firstly, the spread of Western models of capitalism will continue, largely unabated, despite any flaws. Secondly, that the world might experience a violent revolution and an interruption to this sort of enterprise, with an emergence of neo-Marxism, or some equivalent anarchy. And/or, thirdly, the future of viable forms of free enterprise rest in the reformulation of this model as a set of social imaginaries lodged specifically within, and operating in conjunction with local mores, norms, and social frameworks, each of which might produce a unique form of enterprise. To contextualize this discussion, we begin with a foreword offering a review of the structural significance and agency of the imaginaries, that tend to dominate the discourses on this topic in the field of business ethics; and by advancing a summary of conditions that we consider as indicative, significant and structural for any possible analysis or paradigmatic reformulation exercise. To that extent this article is an original and speculative position paper drawing on, reviewing, and interpolating existing literature. Empirical evidence illustrates two of the contrasting imaginaries in the interests of clarity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Anarchic revolution; Evolutionary change; Global capitalism; Social imaginaries","","","","","","","","Anderson B., Imagined Communiities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (Revised), (2006); Appiah K.A., Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, (2007); Banerjee S.B., Transnational Power and Translocal Governance: The Politics of Corporate Responsibility, Human Relations, 71, 6, pp. 796-821, (2018); Banerjee S.B., Chio V.C.M., Mir R., Organizations, Markets and Imperial Formations, (2009); Bevan D., Werhane P., Management, Political Philosophy, and Colonial Interference, Journal of Philosophy of Management, (2021); Boltanski L., Chiapello E., Elliot G., The New Spirit of Capitalism, (2006); Cassirer E., Koelln F.C.A., Pettegrove J.P., Die Philosophie Der Aufklärung, (1932); Castoradis C., L’institution Imaginaire De La société, (1975); Cunningham T., Film Interview of an Maasai Tribe in Uganda with Tom Cunningham for a Series, Big Questions, (2019); Douglass F., West India Emancipation, Speech, (1857); Ehrnstrom-Fuentes M., Delinking Legitimacies: A Pluriversal Perspective on Political CSR, Journal of Management Studies, 53, 3, pp. 433-462, (2016); Escobar A., Culture Sits in Places: Reflections on Globalism and Subaltern Strategies of Localization, Political Geography, 20, pp. 139-174, (2001); Escobar A., Territories of Difference Place Movements, Life, Redes, (2008); Escobar A., Redclift M.R., Woodgate G., Postconstructivist political ecologies, The International Handbook of Environmental Sociology, pp. 91-105, (2010); This is an Emergency, (2021); Foroohar R., Homecoming: The Path to Prosperity in a Postglobal World, (2022); Friedman T., The Lexus and the Olive Tree, (1999); Friedman M., (1962).

We investigate the impact of climate change on economic policy uncertainty and explore the mechanisms and heterogeneity of the impact by constructing the grid area-weighted average temperatures based on monthly panel data of 20 major global economies during 1997–2017. We find that climate change exacerbates economic policy uncertainty. These findings still hold after the robustness test by adjusting the control variables, replacing core explanatory variables and replacing fixed effects. More interestingly, splitting the sample into country groups reveals a considerable contrast in the impact of climate change on economic policy uncertainty. The coefficient on climate change is statistically significant in the case of developing economies, economies with hot climates, low level of trade openness, strong climate impact and high level of corruption. In addition, climate change leads to higher levels of economic policy uncertainty through, reducing economic growth, widening income disparities, increasing inflationary pressures and unemployment rate. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the economic consequences of climate change and policy implications for dealing with climate risks. © 2024 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","Climate change; Economic growth; Economic policy uncertainty; Income inequality; Inflation; Unemployment rate","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71871022, 72271026, 72293601); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (23BJL131); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This work is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 23BJL131 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 72271026 , 72293601 , 71871022 ), and the National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals.

Using methods from the existing literature on climate and economic growth, we analyze the economic impact of rising temperatures by within-country income decile. Our findings suggest that climate change disproportionately affects the poorer segments of the population within countries, even after accounting for a country's ability to adapt to climate impacts, while richer households suffer lower damages. In the reference scenario without additional climate action (3.6°C warming), we estimate that climate impacts could lead to an increase in the Gini index by up to six percentage points, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa. We project impacts to 2100 through the RICE50+ model and estimate the income elasticity of impacts within countries. Our estimates indicate that climate change damages are regressive, with an income elasticity of damages of 0.6 under our preferred specification. On the other hand, climate benefits are approximately distribution-neutral or slightly progressive. © 2024 The Author(s)","Climate change; Climate damages; Climate impacts; Inequality; Panel regression; Vulnerability","Sub-Saharan Africa; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Elasticity; Climate change impact; Climate damage; Climate impacts; Economic impacts; Income distribution; Income elasticities; Income inequality; Inequality; Panel regression; Vulnerability; climate change; climate effect; economic impact; income distribution; vulnerability; Climate change","","","","","European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program; FAERE; Horizon 2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (821124); European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program, (101081369)","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 821124(NAVIGATE) and from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101081369 (SPARCCLE).

Using China as an example, the core objective of this study is to explore the city-level carbon inequality of residential buildings from 2015 to 2020 combined Theil index and Gini coefficient. The outcomes indicate that: (1) Total residential buildings' carbon emissions in 321 Chinese cities increased from 987.81 million tons (Mt) in 2015 to 1161.70 Mt. in 2020; the leading five cities that own the largest carbon emissions are Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Harbin in 2020. (2) Among eight major economic zones of China, the highest residential buildings' carbon emission per capita and residents' disposable income per capita are the Northeast Economic Zone and Eastern Coastal Economic Zone, respectively. (3) Both the Theil index and Gini coefficient show that the overall carbon inequality is higher than income inequality; the Theil index decomposition indicates that city-level carbon inequality has declined; the key forces of carbon emission per capita and disposable income per capita inequality are inter-regional inequality (contribution rate: 55%–63%) and intra-regional inequality (contribution rate: 59%–63%), respectively. (4) Moreover, regarding income earners during 2015–2020 period, the top 10% of 321 cities occupy about 33% in the total national residential buildings' carbon emissions; the medium 40% of cities account for about 42% in total carbon emissions; in contrast, the bottom 50% of cities represent only about 25% of the total carbon emissions. These discoveries emphasize the necessity for the Chinese government to pay more attention to city-level residential building carbon emissions to track advances toward residents' sustainable lifestyles. © 2023","321 Chinese cities; Carbon emission per capita; Carbon inequality; Disposable income per capita; Residential buildings; Theil index","Beijing [China]; China; Harbin; Heilongjiang; Liaoning; Shanghai; Shenyang; Tianjin; Climate change; Coastal zones; Housing; 321 chinese city; Carbon emission per caput; Carbon emissions; Carbon inequality; Chinese cities; Disposable income; Disposable income per caput; Per capita; Residential building; Theil's indices; carbon emission; climate change; governance approach; income distribution; residential location; Carbon","","","","","Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Development Program of China, (CSTB2022TIAD-KPX0130); Social Science Planning Talents Project of Chongqing, (2021YC070)","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support provided by the Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Development Program of China ( CSTB2022TIAD-KPX0130 ) and Social Science Planning Talents Project of Chongqing ( 2021YC070 ).

Yet, the impact of the gender gap in labor participation rates on carbon emission efficiency remains ambiguous. This article employs a data envelopment analysis model to evaluate carbon emission efficiency, utilizing US state-level data from 2010 to 2021 for an empirical investigation into the influence of the gender gap in labor market participation and unemployment rates on carbon emission efficiency. Overall, the narrowing of the gender gap in the labor market contributes to the improvement of carbon emission efficiency. The detailed findings are as follows: (1) diminishing the gender gap in labor force participation and unemployment rates can enhance carbon emission efficiency, a trend particularly pronounced in states that have adopted the Equal Rights Amendment and during the pre-COVID-19 era; (2) gender gap in labor market participation and unemployment rates affects carbon emission efficiency through skilled labor biased technological progress and income inequality and (3) the increase of innovation efficiency, saving rate and endowment structure can mitigate gender gap in labor market participation and unemployment rates’ effects on carbon emission efficiency. © The Author(s) 2024.","carbon emissions; Gender inequality; green economy; sustainable development; technological progress","Carbon emission efficiencies; Carbon emissions; Gender inequality; Green economies; Labour market; Market participations; Participation rate; Structural transformation; Technological progress; Unemployment rates; Low emission","","","","","","","Wang Q., Hu S., Li R., Could information and communication technology (ICT) reduce carbon emissions?

This paper uses the functional entropy weight method to calculate the level of natural disasters from 2004 to 2020. Then, this paper discusses the impact of natural disasters on the urban-rural income gap. The empirical results are as follows. (1) Natural disasters have expanded the urban-rural income gap. The regression coefficient is 0.2663, which is significant at the 1% level. (2) In areas with a high proportion of the rural population, the impact of natural disasters is more prominent. (3) Mechanism analysis indicates that natural disasters have widened the urban-rural income gap by restraining rural investment and agricultural production. Finally, this paper suggests strengthening investment in the agricultural sector to mitigate the negative impact of natural disasters. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Functional data analysis; Natural disasters; Rural investment; Urban-rural income gap","China; Agriculture; Climate change; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Rural areas; Entropy weight method; Functional data analysis; Income inequality; Mechanism analysis; Natural disasters; Regression coefficient; Rural investment; Rural population; Urban-rural; Urban-rural income gap; entropy; natural disaster; rural area; spatiotemporal analysis; Investments","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (22JZD008); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72133003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program, No 72133003 ) and Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education , (Grant No.: 22JZD008 ).","Lou Z., Xu H., Xia L., Lin W., Dai Z., Wang X., Enhanced freeze-thaw cycles facilitate the antibiotic resistance proliferation and dissemination risk under global climate change, Process Saf Environ Protect, 175, pp. 119-128, (2023); Odunola O., Odunsi O., Daramola O., Climate change evidence and effects of climate‐change‐related diseases on children's health, Environ Qual Manag, 28, pp. 47-55, (2018); Wei S., Zhou Q., Luo Z., She Y., Wang Q., Chen J., Qu S., Wei Y., Economic impacts of multiple natural disasters and agricultural adaptation measures on supply chains in China, J Clean Prod, 418, (2023); Ramlall I., Should central banks manage climate change risk via a CO2 emissions augmented Taylor rule?

The results indicate that the short-run and long-run effects of the income share of the top 10 % and the top 5 % on province-level emissions are positive, robust to various model specifications, net of multiple demographic and economic factors, not sensitive to exogenous shocks or outlier cases, symmetrical, statistically equivalent for emissions from different sectors, and their short-term effects do not vary in magnitude through time. The findings also consistently show that the estimated effect of the Gini coefficient on province-level emissions is not statistically significant. Overall, the results underscore the importance in modeling the effects of income inequality measures that quantify different characteristics of income distributions, and they are very consistent with analytical approaches regarding power concentration, overconsumption, and status competition that suggest that a higher concentration of income leads to growth in anthropogenic carbon emissions. © 2024 The Authors","Canada; Carbon emissions; Climate change; Climate mitigation; Income inequality","","","","","","","","Givens J., Kelly O., Jorgenson A., Inequality, emissions, and human well-being, Handbook of Inequality and the Environment, pp. 308-324, (2023); Rosa E., Dietz T., Human drivers of national greenhouse-gas emissions, Nat.

Cooling adaptation via air conditioning (AC) is effective, but energy-intensive and constrained by household-level differences in income and adaptive capacity. Using statistical models trained on a large multi-country household survey dataset (n = 673,215), we project AC adoption and energy use to mid-century at fine spatial resolution worldwide. Globally, the share of households with residential AC could grow from 27% to 41% (range of scenarios assessed: 33-48%), implying up to a doubling of residential cooling electricity consumption, from 1220 to 1940 (scenarios range: 1590-2377) terawatt-hours yr.−1, emitting between 590 and 1,365 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e). AC access and utilization will remain highly unequal within and across countries and income groups, with significant regressive impacts. Up to 4 billion people may lack air-conditioning in 2050. Our global gridded projections facilitate incorporation of AC’s vulnerability, health, and decarbonization effects into integrated assessments of climate change. © The Author(s) 2024.","","adaptive management; air conditioning; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; cooling; demographic transition; energy use; household survey; spatial resolution; adaptation; air conditioning; Article; carbon dioxide equivalent; carbon utilization; climate change; cooling; electricity; energy consumption; household income; human; income inequality; lowest income group; residential area; sociodemographics; article; controlled study; household; income group; male; thermal exposure; vulnerability; warming","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Biological and Environmental Research Program, Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling, (DE-SC0016162, DE-SC0022141); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (756194); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC, (101081358); European Commission, EC","This research was funded by the European Union.

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs panel data from 53 African countries between 2004 and 2021 and utilises the random-effects model and two-step generalised method of moments (GMM) to estimate the relationships amongst DFI, income inequality, CO2 emissions and renewable energy consumption (REC). Findings: Our findings reveal that increased accessibility to automated teller machines (ATMs) leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions and an increase in REC. However, the effect of ATMs on CO2 emissions is stronger for individuals with lower incomes, whereas REC is higher for those with higher incomes. Additionally, mobile cellular subscriptions (MCS) increase both CO2 emissions and REC; however, when income inequality is considered, it results in a reduction in CO2 emissions and an increase in REC. Furthermore, Internet usage reduces CO2 emissions and increases REC in Africa, with income inequality levels further improving its contribution. Practical implications: ATM accessibility and energy efficiency are means to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions and encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to explore the effects of income inequality on DFI, CO2 emissions and REC, highlighting its importance in Africa and its potential impact on environmental sustainability. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","African countries; CO2 emissions; Digital financial inclusion; Income inequality; Renewable energy consumption","Africa; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental economics; income distribution; sustainability","","","","","","","Allen F., Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Peria M.S.M., The foundations of financial inclusion: understanding ownership and use of formal accounts, Journal of financial Intermediation, 27, pp. 1-30, (2016); Asongu N., Odhiambo N., The role of mobile characteristics on mobile money innovations, Quality and Quantity, 31, 6, pp. 1-18, (2022); Aziz A., Naima U., Rethinking digital financial inclusion: evidence from Bangladesh, Technology in Society, 64, (2021); Ben-Amar W., Comyns B., Martinez I., The COVID-19 pandemic: opportunity or challenge for climate change risk disclosure?, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 36, 2, pp. 649-676, (2022); Dasgupta S., Laplante B., Wang H., Wheeler D., Confronting the environmental Kuznets curve, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 16, 1, pp. 147-168, (2002); Demirguc-Kunt A., Levine R., Finance and Growth, (2018); Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Singer D., Ansar S., The Global Findex Database 2021, (2022); Gao B., Han X., Ye F., Li Y., Internet usage and household electricity consumption, Frontiers in Energy Research, 11, (2023); Gao S., Zhu Y., Umar M., Kchouri B., Safi A., Financial inclusion empowering sustainable technologies: insights into the E-7 economies from COP28 perspectives, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 201, (2024); Gujarati D.N., Bernier B., Bernier B., Econométrie, (2004); Ha L.T., Trade values in environmental commodities and environment performance: insights from global database, Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal, 34, 3, pp. 670-703, (2023); Han C., Phillips P.C., GMM with many moment conditions, Econometrica, 74, 1, pp. 147-192, (2006); Han Y., Tan S., Zhu C., Liu Y., Research on the emission reduction effects of carbon trading mechanism on power industry: plant-level evidence from China, International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management, 15, 2, pp. 212-231, (2022); Hansen L.P., Large sample properties of generalized method of moments estimators, Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 50, 4, pp. 1029-1054, (1982); Jum'a L., Alkalha Z., Alaraj M., Towards environmental sustainability: the nexus between green supply chain management, total quality management, and environmental management practices, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 41, 5, pp. 1209-1234, (2024); Kang J.-N., Wei Y.-M., Liu L.-C., Han R., Yu B.-Y., Wang J.-W., Energy systems for climate change mitigation: a systematic review, Applied Energy, 263, (2020); Khan Y., Khan M.A., Zafar S., Dynamic linkages among energy consumption, urbanization and ecological footprint: empirical evidence from NARDL approach, Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal, 34, 6, pp. 1534-1554, (2023); Maldonado-Guzman G., Garza-Reyes J.A., Pinzon-Castro S.Y., Green innovation and firm performance: the mediating role of sustainability in the automotive industry, Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal, 34, 6, pp. 1690-1711, (2023); Mohammadi M.M., Safari Gerayli M., Shahri M., Valiyan H., Dehdar F., Towards a framework for the protection of citizen rights of capital market shareholders: evidence from Iran, Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 16, 2, pp. 310-330, (2024); Mukhi U., Quental C., New normal and old wisdom: converging CEO and academic perspectives for responsible management education and leadership, Responsible Management of Shifts in Work Modes–Values for Post Pandemic Sustainability, 2, pp. 35-50, (2023); Nielsen K.S., Clayton S., Stern P.C., Dietz T., Capstick S., Whitmarsh L., How psychology can help limit climate change, American Psychologist, 76, 1, pp. 130-144, (2021); Okello Candiya Bongomin G., Ntayi J., Trust: mediator between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion, Social Responsibility Journal, 16, 8, pp. 1215-1237, (2020); Pearson K., Contributions to the mathematical theory of evolution, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This paper describes factual belief polarization in the Netherlands around three core issues. Furthermore, this paper examines who are most susceptible to this type of polarization. Analyses on the 2021 Dutch Parliamentary Election Study reveal that citizens hold different perceptions than their political opponents about income inequality, immigration, and climate change. This type of polarization is strongest among citizens who have hostile feelings toward their political opponents and, paradoxically, among those who are highly educated and interested in politics. Trust in epistemic authorities did not mitigate factual belief polarization, perhaps because this trust has itself become politicized. These findings underline that factual belief polarization constitutes a core pillar of political polarization, alongside ideological and affective polarization. © The Author(s) 2022.","Affective polarization; Climate change; Factual belief polarization; Media trust; Misperceptions","","","","","","Swedish Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, (M18-0310:1); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","Open access funding provided by University of Gothenburg.

This study addresses this gap by investigating racial and economic disparities in high-temperature exposure in Brazil, focusing on the impact on vulnerable subpopulations. We utilized georeferenced temperature data from the Global High-Resolution Estimates of Extreme Heat (GEHE) and population data from the 2010 Census. The disparity analyses included (i) estimating the exposure rate to temperatures exceeding 28 °C, expressed as population-weighted heat exposure ((Formula presented.)); (ii) determining the difference in exposure between the most and least exposed groups; and (iii) calculating weighted Gini coefficients. The findings reveal that low-income and black, brown, and indigenous populations are predominantly the most exposed to (Formula presented.) exceeding 28 °C. Nationally, the indigenous population is the most exposed racial group, with a (Formula presented.) 47% higher than that of the white population. Stratified analyses indicate that, despite varying climatic and environmental conditions across regions, the black-brown-indigenous population consistently faces the highest heat exposure in Brazil. Income disparity analyses show that the lowest per capita income groups are the most exposed to high temperatures across the country. The study highlights the impact of climate change on economic inequality and the deepening of within-country inequalities, particularly affecting socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. These findings underscore the urgent need for evidence-informed public policies to address racial and economic disparities in high-temperature exposure, mitigate health risks associated with climate change, and emphasize the importance of context-sensitive analyses for a comprehensive understanding of heat-related risks and public health. © 2025 by the authors.","disparities; extreme temperature; vulnerable subpopulations; weather","Brazil; Climate Change; Environmental Exposure; Health Status Disparities; Hot Temperature; Humans; Racial Groups; Socioeconomic Factors; Brazil; economic conditions; high temperature; racial disparity; temperature effect; vulnerability; weather; Article; Brazil; census tract; climate change; economic inequality; environmental disease; exposure; Gini coefficient; global high resolution estimates of extreme heat; health hazard; high temperature; human; income group; income inequality; lowest income group; physical activity; public health; racial disparity; sensitivity analysis; temperature; thermal exposure; vulnerable subpopulation; weather; wet bulb globe temperature; ancestry group; climate change; environmental exposure; health disparity; socioeconomics","","","","","Brazilian Agencies National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Brazilian research Agency FAPDF; Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Distrito Federal, FAPDF","This research was funded by the Brazilian Agencies National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and by the Brazilian research Agency FAPDF (Federal District Research Support Foundation).","Ebi K., Hess J.J., Health risks due to climate change: Inequity in causes and consequences: Study examines health risks due to climate change, Health Aff, 39, pp. 2056-2062, (2020); Roca-Barcelo A., Fecht D., Pirani M., Piel F.B., Nardocci A.C., Vineis P., Trends in temperature-associated mortality in são paulo (brazil) between 2000 and 2018: An example of disparities in adaptation to cold and heat, J.

The research unfolded in the Kalyani Sub-division of West Bengal, India, encompassing both urban and rural landscapes. Data collection entailed comprehensive interviews with 610 households during the period spanning December 2021–May 2022. Statistical analysis was rigorously executed through SPSS, while carbon footprint computations drew upon the well-regarded Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission accounting methodology. Analysing global carbon dioxide emissions spanning 1850–2011, the study underscores the alarming surge in emissions driven by industrialization and non-renewable energy consumption. The ensuing disparities in emissions across nations and regions are attributed to socioeconomic factors, urbanization, and individual lifestyle choices. It becomes evident that socioeconomic status, education, and gender roles exert significant influence over energy consumption behaviour, with higher educational attainment correlating with heightened environmental awareness. Simultaneously, income inequality acts as a structural constraint, limiting sustainable behaviour adoption. Education emerges as a potent tool in mitigating structural limitations, challenging traditional gender norms, and addressing income disparities are deemed essential for universal access to sustainable practices. This research urges the formulation of context-specific interventions and policies to tackle the multifaceted drivers of carbon emissions, providing policymakers and practitioners with valuable insights into promoting environmental sustainability. Future research should delve into diverse sociocultural contexts and rigorously assess intervention efficacy, enriching our understanding of the complex interplay between habits, structural constraints, and carbon emissions, and guiding us towards a more sustainable and equitable future. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Energy consumption; Habitus; Household carbon footprint; Pierre Bourdieu; Structural constraints; Sustainability","India; Nadia; West Bengal; carbon footprint; educational attainment; energy use; income distribution; industrialization; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; lifestyle; sustainability","","","","","Indian Council of Social Science Research, ICSSR, (RFD/2021-22/GEN/ENV/299); Indian Council of Social Science Research, ICSSR","The authors are thankful to the respondents for participating in the study and providing their precious time and information.

While there is extensive evidence on the direct impacts of climate change on human livelihood, there is little evidence on how children and young people are affected, and even less discussion and evidence on how the climate crisis could affect violence against children. Participants and setting: In this commentary, we review selected research to assess the links between the climate crisis and violence against children. Methods: We employ a social-ecological perspective as an overarching framework to organize findings from the literature and call attention to increased violence against children as a specific, yet under-examined, direct and indirect consequence of the climate crisis. Results: Using such a perspective, we examine how the climate crisis exacerbates the risk of violence against children at the continually intersecting and interacting levels of society, community, family, and the individual levels. We propose increased risk of armed conflict, forced displacement, poverty, income inequality, disruptions in critical health and social services, and mental health problems as key mechanisms linking the climate crisis and heightened risk of violence against children. Furthermore, we posit that the climate crisis serves as a threat multiplier, compounding existing vulnerabilities and inequities within populations and having harsher consequences in settings, communities, households, and for children already experiencing adversities. Conclusions: We conclude with a call for urgent efforts from researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to further investigate the specific empirical links between the climate crisis and violence against children and to design, test, implement, fund, and scale evidence-based, rights-based, and child friendly prevention, support, and response strategies to address violence against children. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change;

The fundamental role that housing plays in people's lives makes these effects particularly pernicious, often impacting employment, school attendance, undermining physical and mental health, disrupting social networks, and contributing to food insecurity. The complexity of addressing these issues is compounded by the cyclical and reciprocal relationships among these factors, with housing inequalities frequently lying at the core and climate change impacts percolating throughout. I introduce the framework of acute, secondary, and pre-emptive/reactive impacts to help understand these mechanisms. To understand and contextualize these connections, I provide a brief overview racial segregation in the United States and related inequalities that place some individuals, groups, and communities at greater risk. Other key sources of housing instability in the United States that are often closely related to housing segregation include lack of affordable housing, growing income inequality, housing discrimination, evictions, and foreclosures, all of which contribute to unequal housing outcomes. These factors are explored using the temporal framework to discuss their connection to climate change, which is in and of itself a major force of housing instability. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate change; homeownership; housing; housing affordability; housing insecurity; housing instability; natural disasters; segregation","","","","","","","","Aurand A., Emmanuel D., Yentel D., The gap: A shortage of affordable homes.

Drawing on contributions from nearly 70 leading migration scholars, mainly from the Global South, the handbook challenges dominant conceptualisations of migration, offering new perspectives and insights that can inform theoretical and policy understandings and unlock migration's development potential. The handbook is divided into four parts, each highlighting often overlooked mobility patterns within and between regions of the Global South, as well as the inequalities faced by those who move. Key cross-cutting themes include gender, race, poverty and income inequality, migration decision making, intermediaries, remittances, technology, climate change, food security and migration governance. The handbook is an indispensable resource on South-South migration and inequality for academics, researchers, postgraduates and development practitioners. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

However there are few of empirical studies investigating the relationship and interaction mechanisms between climate change and women’s political empowerment under the background of sustainable development. Here, using a two-way fixed-effects model, and a large balanced panel data of 132 countries from 1995 to 2023, we provide new evidence on the relationship and interaction mechanisms between climate change and women’s political empowerment. We conclude that climate change has a negative impact on women’s political empowerment and income inequality magnifies the effect. Subsample analysis shows the negative impact is particularly pronounced in countries with right-wing parties in power and high levels of economic development. Moreover, government efficiency, political stability and sustainable development ability slows down the impact of climate change on women’s political empowerment and has a positive moderating effect. Our paper provides new insights for research in related fields. © 2025, Politechnika Lubelska.

The authors use a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to capture different dimensions of vulnerability. Using the multidimensional vulnerability framework (MVI), they analyze socioeconomic indicators, including poverty rates, income inequality, access to essential services, and economic well-being in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Environmental factors such as water scarcity, pollution levels, and natural resource degradation are also included to understand the ecological challenges those communities face, and political factors, including governance structures and policies, determine their influence on vulnerability and resilience. The result indicates that the community prioritizes ecological indicators over social ones. However, in each community this is heterogeneous. In both cases, the ecological and social indicators selected allow for a multidisciplinary approach to vulnerability. By identifying and understanding these issues, policy makers, researchers, and community leaders can work collaboratively to design strategies to mitigate the impacts of these vulnerabilities. In addition, architects and urban planners can offer specific interventions to benefit these communities. This research contributes to the broader field of vulnerability studies by demonstrating the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing the complex web of vulnerability faced by communities in northern Mexico and territories that share similar characteristics. © 2023 by the authors.","architecture and design; climate change; Mexico; multidimensional vulnerability framework (MVI); sustainable development goals (SDGs); vulnerability","Chihuahua [Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; climate change; environmental degradation; environmental factor; natural resource; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; Sustainable Development Goal; vulnerability","","","","","Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, ITESM","This research was funded by the Challenge Based Research Funding Program 2022 of Tencológico de Monterrey, grant number E021-EAAD-GI01-B-T1-E, through the project “Design for Vulnerable—Technology Challenge.

It aims to identify key concepts in this research area and summarize the main findings of previous studies. The study is based on trends in the number of papers, keyword analysis, and an examination of the progression of the research topics over time. It identifies three main clusters of sustainable development—economic, social, and environmental—as well as the top authors, countries, organizations, the most frequently cited papers, reference papers, and journals. The study presents specific trends highlighting the role of financial inclusion in promoting economic growth, reducing income inequality and poverty, and mitigating climate change. This review provides a comprehensive perspective on the role of financial inclusion in sustainable development, emphasizing the need for integrated strategies that combine economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability. It recommends ideas for future research to further explore these relationships, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in developing inclusive and sustainable development policies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Bibliometric analysis; CiteSpace; Content analysis; Financial inclusion; O16; O35; O44; Q20; Sustainable development; VOSviewer; WordStat; Y10","","","","","","","","Achugamonu U.B., Adetiloye K.A., Adegbite E.O., Babajide A.A., Akintola F.A., Financial exclusion of bankable adults: Implication on financial inclusive growth among twenty-seven SSA countries, Cogent Social Sciences, 6, 1, (2020); Adegbite O.O., Machethe C.L., Bridging the financial inclusion gender gap in smallholder agriculture in Nigeria: An untapped potential for sustainable development, World Development, 127, (2020); Akeju K.F., Household financial behaviour: The role of financial inclusion instruments in Nigeria, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, (2022); Ali K., Jianguo D., Kirikkaleli D., Modeling the natural resources and financial inclusion on ecological footprint: The role of economic governance institutions, Evidence from ECOWAS Economies.

This study uses a descriptive analysis method along with panel data analysis to assess the impact of climate changes on income inequality in 42 advanced economies and 68 developing countries between 1995 and 2020. The results of empirical research confirm that climate change is an important factor responsible for growing income inequality. The impact of a country’s vulnerability is positively associated with increasing income inequality in low-income economies. In turn, climate resilience has a statistically significant effect on income distribution in both groups, although the ability to mitigate climate change and adapt is considerably weaker in developing countries. This research raises our awareness of the links between the economy and climate change, including their implications for income inequality, and signals possible changes in the redistributive system to mitigate climate change and combat income inequality. The added value of this article is the results of research on the negative consequences of climate change on income inequality in over 100 countries. Particular attention was paid to the ethical issue of unequal responsibility for causing climate change between rich and poor countries. © 2024, Wydawnictwo Ekonomia i Srodowisko.

This study finds that (1) climate change has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the urban–rural income disparity; (2) climate change can affect the urban–rural income disparity by influencing urban and rural income levels, the regional degree of urbanization, and the labor force employment structure; (3) the impact of climate change on the urban–rural income gap is heterogeneous in East, Center, and West China; and (4) extreme heat can widen the urban–rural income gap, and extreme drought can narrow the urban–rural income gap. Climate change has a significant impact on the urban–rural income gap, and there is a need to continue to promote urbanization and the optimization of the employment structure of the workforce, reduce the vulnerability of rural residents to climate change, and narrow the urban–rural income gap. © 2023 by the authors.","climate change; employment structure; urbanization; urban–rural income gap","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (19ZDA151); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation Major Project “Research on Multidimensional Identification and Collaborative Governance of Relative Poverty in China” (grant number 19ZDA151).","AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; Carleton T.A., Hsiang S.M., Social and economic impacts of climate, Science, 353, (2016); Burke M., Hsiang S.M., Miguel E., Climate and conflict, Annu.

To address this empirical and knowledge gap, the analysis of the paper begins with theoretical perspectives on the diffusion of green growth technologies and how it relates to income inequality. We collected annual data from selected Global South countries from 1991 to 2019 and then used the pooled mean group-autoregressive distribution lag (PMG-ARDL) and the augmented mean group-autoregressive distribution lag (AMG-ARDL) as a benchmark estimation methods and cross-sectional autoregressive distribution lag (CS-ARDL) for robustness checks to investigate the short-and long-run implications for green growth. The results show that higher income inequality is associated with reduced green growth in the long run, whereas the short-run results are mixed.

Similarly, the manufacturing and export of a wide variety of high-tech, knowledge-based items like chemicals and machinery have significant effects on both economic growth and the environment. The main goal of this study is to examine the long-run effects of economic complexity on energy efficiency in 93 countries over the period from 1995 to 2015. The empirical outcomes reveal that economic complexity improves energy efficiency. Specifically, countries that produce and export a wide range of sophisticated products tend to enjoy higher levels of energy efficiency compared to their counterparts who export a limited range of simple products. Moreover, empirical findings suggest that economic growth and population density increase energy efficiency, while trade impedes it. Further empirical investigations from a mediation analysis revealed that about 63% and 38% of the effects of economic complexity on energy efficiency mediate through income inequality reduction and human capital accumulation, respectively.

Recycling PW reduces the demand for virgin materials, thereby conserving natural resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction and production of virgin materials. Furthermore, PW recycling can impact the social and economic well-being of communities. This study investigates the confluence of income inequalities, digital consumption, materialism, and social protection, and their nexus with paper waste streams in a sample of 28 EU countries from the period of 2000 to 2020, using various statistical methods. Countries with higher levels of material consumption tend to have lower levels of PW recycling, while increased e-commerce activity and income concentration among a few individuals are robustly associated with decreased recycling performance. Conversely, social protection expenditures are positively correlated with PW recycling in both the short-and long-run. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Circular economy;

Degrowth proponents argue that human economic activity could be lessened, and societies transformed to prioritize improved wellbeing, reducing the threat of climate change. This paper explores implications of alternative patterns of economic growth with transformational policy pathways (i.e., redistribution) to assess what effects economic growth and broader policies have on changing patterns of human development across both the Global North and South. Using the International Futures model, this article shows that negative growth and societal transformations in the Global North are possible without dramatically damaging long-term global socioeconomic development, though these interventions do not solve the global climate crisis, reducing future cumulative carbon emissions by 10.5% through 2100. On the other hand, a global negative growth scenario will significantly reduce future cumulative carbon emissions (45%) but also dramatically undermines the pursuit of global development goals, like the elimination of poverty. Even with global policies that significantly increase cash transfers to the poor and retired, dramatically improve income inequality, and eliminate military spending, the Global Negative Growth Big Push scenario leads to an increase of 15 percentage points in global extreme poverty by 2100. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","army; article; carbon emission; economic development; extreme poverty; global climate; human; human development; income inequality; poverty","","","","","","","Longacre D.J., More-With-Less Cookbook, (1981); Shukla P.R., Et al., IPCC, 2019: Climate Change and Land: An IPCC Special Report on Climate Change, Desertification, Land Degradation, Sustainable Land Management, Food Security, and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Terrestrial Ecosystems, (2019); Trisos C.H., Merow C., Pigot A.L., The projected timing of abrupt ecological disruption from climate change, Nature, 580, pp. 496-501, (2020); Abd-Elmabod S.K., Et al., Climate change impacts on agricultural suitability and yield reduction in a Mediterranean region, Geoderma, 374, (2020); Chapra S.C., Et al., Climate change impacts on harmful algal blooms in U.S. freshwaters: A screening-level assessment, Environ.

This article argues that a concurrent reexamination must also take place within the foundations and philosophy of business education. As such, this essay explores nine broad themes for such a transformational reexamination: (1) instill an ethos of management as a calling, (2) rebuild the business school on a system of aspirational principles, (3) de-emphasize the core, (4) move beyond simply monetary measures, (5) train stewards of the market, (6) reexamine the purpose of the corporation, (7) discard misguided metrics and models, (8) bring the government back in, and (9) pay proper attention to citizenship. The article also discusses obstacles to such a grand revisioning, and offers examples that change is underway. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate change; corporate governance; corporate social responsibility; income inequality; institutional change; markets; topics and perspectives","","","","","","","","Ackoff R., From data to wisdom, Journal of Applied Systems Analysis, 16, 1, pp. 3-9, (1989); MBA Salary, What You Can Earn, (2019); Alvaredo F., Chancel L., Piketty T., Et al., World Inequality Report, (2018); Ideas Worth Teaching Awards, (2020); Bachrach D.G., Bendoly E., Ammeter D.B., Et al., On academic rankings, unacceptable methods, and the social obligations of business schools, Decision Sciences, 48, 3, pp. 561-585, (2017); Bansal P., DesJardine M., Business sustainability: It is about time, Strategic Organization, 12, 1, pp. 70-78, (2014); Beinhocker E., Hanauer N., Redefining capitalism, McKinsey Quarterly, 3, pp. 160-169, (2014); Benjamin J., Business class, The New Republic, (2018); Bennis W., O'Toole J., How business schools have lost their way, Harvard Business Review, 83, 5, pp. 96-104, (2005); Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018, (2019); Boaz D., Young people like “socialism,” but do they know what it is?, Cato Institute, (2018); (2019); Cifuentes A., Espinoza D., Infrastructure investing and the peril of discounted cash flow, Financial Times, (2016); Dizikes P., The productive career of Robert Solow, MIT News, (2020); Drucker P., The Practice of Management, (1954); Eavis P., It’s never been easier to be a C.E.O., and the pay keeps rising, The New York Times, (2019); Ergene S., Banerjee B., Hoffman A., (Un)sustainability and organization studies: Towards a radical engagement, Organization Studies, (2020); Farrell S., Damaged ideology”: Business must reinvent capitalism—Ex-Unilever boss, The Guardian, (2019); Fink L., Larry Fink’s 2019 Letter to CEOS: Purpose & Profit, (2019); Gamble J., The most important problem in the word, Medium, (2019); Gardner M., Wamhoff S., Martellotta M., Et al., Corporate Tax Avoidance Remains Rampant Under New Tax Law, (2019); Ghoshal S., Bad management theories are destroying good management practices, Academy of Management Learning & Education, 4, 1, pp. 75-91, (2005); Gould S.J., The creation myths of Cooperstown, Natural History, 11, pp. 14-24, (1989); Guerrera F., Welch condemns share price focus, Financial Times, (2009); Henderson R., Reimagining Capitalism in a World on Fire, (2020); Hoffman A., Management as a calling, Stanford Social Innovation Review, (2018); Jack A., The rise of the “sustainable” MBA, Financial Times, (2020); Jaffe G., Capitalism in crisis: U.S. billionaires worry about the survival of the system that made them rich, (2019); Khurana R., From Higher Aims to Hired Hands: The Social Transformation of American Business Schools and the Unfulfilled Promise of Management as a Profession, (2010); Lafaki C., Ratz L., Fazio E., Et al., The Economic Implications of Climate Change, (2019); Long S., The financialization of the American elite, American Affairs, (2019); Lyon T., Delmas M.A., Maxwell J.W., Et al., CSR needs CPR: Corporate sustainability and politics, California Management Review, 60, 4, pp. 5-24, (2018); Martin E., The government shutdown spotlights a bigger issue: 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck, CNBC, (2019); Maxwell N., From Knowledge to Wisdom: A Revolution for Science and the Humanities, (2007); Morris C., 42% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement, Fortune, (2018); Murray S., MBA teaching urged to move away from focus on shareholder primacy model, Financial Times, (2013); Business as Unusual: The Social and Environmental Impact Guide to Graduate Programs—For Students by Students, (2014); Oreskes N., Oppenheimer M., Jamieson D., Scientists have been underestimating the pace of climate change, Scientific American, (2019); Parker M., Shut Down the Business School: What’s Wrong with Management Education, (2018); Peterson K., Pfitzer M., Lobbying for good, Stanford Social Innovation Review, (2009); Economic fairness, Corporate profits and tax policy, (2017); Reich R., Philanthropy in the service of democracy, (2019); Riback C., Joseph Stiglitz: Saving capitalism from itself, Chris Riback’s Conversations, (2019); Ross M., Bateman N., Low unemployment isn’t worth much of the jobs barely pay, Brookings Institution, (2020); Ross Sorkin A., Ex-corporate lawyer’s idea: Rein in “sociopaths” in the boardroom, New York Times, (2019); Schumacher E.F., Small Is Beautiful: Economics as If People Mattered, (1973); Schwab K., Davos Manifesto 2020: The Universal Purpose of a Company in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2020); Stern N., The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review, (2007); Stiglitz J., It’s time to retire metrics like GDP.

Here, we explore the effect of international trade on the carbon intensity of human well-being (CIWB) globally under the current global trade system and a hypothetical no-trade scenario. We found that between 1995 and 2015, CIWB of 41% of countries declined and 59% of countries increased, caused by international trade, and this resulted in a reduction of the global CIWB and a decline in CIWB inequality between countries. International trade decreased CIWB for high- and upper-middle-income countries and increased CIWB for lower- and middle-income countries. In addition, our results also show that decreases in emission intensity are the most important driver of lower CIWB and the percentage contribution of emission intensity to the improvement in CIWB increases with income. The reduction of emission intensity, population growth, and increase in life expectancy all contribute to CIWB reduction, while the consumption level is the primary factor driving CIWB growth. Our results underscore the importance of studying the impact of international trade on the CIWB of countries at different stages of development. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","carbon intensity of human well-being; drivers; global courtiers; international trade","Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Commerce; Economic Development; Humans; Internationality; Carbon; Economic and social effects; Population statistics; carbon; carbon dioxide; % reductions; 'current; Carbon intensity; Carbon intensity of human well-being; Driver; Emissions intensity; Global courtier; Middle-income countries; Trade off; Well being; carbon emission; economic development; environmental economics; global perspective; global trade; life expectancy; trade-environment relations; trade-off; Africa; Article; Asia; Australia; carbon emission; climate change; developing country; environmental impact; environmental indicator; environmental protection; Europe; Gini coefficient; greenhouse gas emission; high income country; human; income inequality; life expectancy; low income country; middle income country; natural resource; North America; population growth; South America; trade (economics); wellbeing; commercial phenomena; economic development; international cooperation; International trade","","carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon, ; Carbon Dioxide, ","","","Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42121001); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (21YJAZH087)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42121001) and Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund of the Ministry of Education (21YJAZH087).","Schmitz C., Biewald A., Lotze-Campen H., Popp A., Dietrich J.P., Bodirsky B., Krause M., Weindl I., Trading more food: Implications for land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and the food system, Global Environ Change, 22, pp. 189-209, (2012); Ayres R.U., Commentary on the utility of the ecological footprint concept, Ecol.

As a case study, we select Colombia, a Latin American country with almost 10% of its inhabitants living in extreme poverty. We elaborate a water–food–labour (WFL) nexus grounded on a sub-national Environmentally Extended Input–Output (EEIO) analysis to assess the virtual water trade (VWT) and virtual informal labour (VIL) flows across administrative departments and economic sectors related to domestic trade. The main results are the following: high cross-departmental resource interdependence both in terms of VWT and VIL, rich departments highly depend on the resources of their neighbouring trading partners, extreme poverty conditions shown by economically isolated departments, and considerable income inequality in the food production sectors. Moreover, departments that are net exporters of virtual water suffer from water stress that might be exacerbated by future high rainfall variability due to climate change. These results suggest that strategies to attain sustainable development goals (SDGs) must deal with the biophysical constraints and the economic and political feasibility of the proposed solutions. In this vein, we argue that a holistic framework, grounded on quantitative analyses, is necessary to support informed policy decisions for the simultaneous achievement of multiple (possibly contrasting) goals. Moreover, severe spatial imbalances call for local policy responses coordinated at the national level. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Environmentally extended input–output; Inequality; Informal labour; Spatial analysis; Sustainable development goals; Virtual water","Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Planning; Colombia; Environmentally extended input–output; Inequality; Informal labor; Input-output; Poorest countries; Spatial analysis; Sustainable development goal; Virtual water; Virtual water trade; Sustainable development","","","","","","","Abramo L., Cecchini S., Morales B., Social Programmes, Poverty Eradication and Labour Inclusion.

Addressing these challenges and ensuring sustainable development become a pressing issue for policymakers. This paper investigates the impact of GHG emissions on income inequality in Africa. The study uses a panel data set from 49 countries from 1981 to 2015 and shows that GHG emission widens income inequality. The result is robust for alternative emission indicators. A direct implication is that climate change policy should be designed to narrow income inequality. It is emphasized that mitigation actions should focus on the agriculture sector. Hence, intervention towards energy-smart agriculture, land conservation practices, exploiting the job creation potential, and strengthening value addition in the agricultural sector is decisive. Reforming agriculture reduces emission, narrows income inequality, and realizes sustainable development on the continent. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2 stage least square;

Accordingly, territories differ in terms of exposure to climate events, of capacity to adopt climate mitigation policies and of the welfare effects that these deep transformations entail. The paper brings together these threads with an empirical study of the relationship between green technology development and income inequality in US metropolitan areas over the period 2005–15. We find a positive association between local patenting capacity and growing income gaps to the detriment of the least affluent. Further, higher patenting propensity in early-stage technologies has a stronger association with income inequality, whereas such a relationship dissipates at later stages of the life cycle. © 2023 Regional Studies Association.","environmental technologies; inequality; technology life cycle","","","","","","PRTR; European Union fund NextGenerationEU; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MCIN, (PID2020-119096RB-I00/MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033)","Davide Consoli: Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00F3n (PID2020-119096RB-I00/MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033).

We provide empirical evidence in the global context using the novel method of moments quantile regression. We found that Income Inequality across the globe is sharply reduced by restrictive environmental tax policy, a finding that has ramifications for global sustainable development, particularly in dealing with the ravaging effects of Covid-19. © 2023 The Author(s).

Although studies find that climate change might increase global inequality by widening disparities across countries, its effects on within-country income distribution have been little investigated, as has the role of rainfall anomalies. Here, we show that extreme levels of precipitation exacerbate within-country income inequality. The strength and direction of the effect depends on the agricultural intensity of an economy. In high-agricultural-intensity countries, climate anomalies that negatively impact the agricultural sector lower incomes at the bottom end of the distribution and generate greater income inequality. Our results indicate that a 1.5-SD increase in precipitation from average values has a 35-times-stronger impact on the bottom income shares for countries with high employment in agriculture compared to countries with low employment in the agricultural sector. Projections with modeled future precipitation and temperature reveal highly heterogeneous patterns on a global scale, with income inequality worsening in high-agricultural-intensity economies, particularly in Africa. Our findings suggest that rainfall anomalies and the degree of dependence on agriculture are crucial factors in assessing the negative impacts of climate change on the bottom of the income distribution.

Here, we use hourly heat stress data modeled with a regional climate model to investigate the heat-induced labor loss in 231 Chinese cities. Results indicate that future urban heat stress is projected to cause an increase in labor losses exceeding 0.20% of the total account gross domestic product (GDP) per year by the 2050s relative to the 2010s. In this process, certain lower-paid sectors could be disproportionately impacted. The implementation of various urban adaptation strategies could offset 10% of the additional economic loss per year and help reduce the inequality-related impact on lower-paid sectors. So future urban warming can not only damage cities as a whole but can also contribute to income inequality. The implication of adaptation strategies should be considered in regard to not only cooling requirements but also environmental justice. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Acclimatization; Body Temperature Regulation; Climate Change; Climate Models; Cold Temperature; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; China; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; cooling; environmental justice; Gross Domestic Product; nature-society relations; regional climate; strategic approach; warming; article; city; climate model; cooling; environmental justice; gross national product; heat stress; income inequality; labor induction; warming; acclimatization; climate change; cold; female; human; pregnancy; thermoregulation","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820655); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82030103, 92043301); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906100127); China Scholarship Council, CSC","This work was conducted when C.H. visited Boston University in 2019–2020, which was supported by the China Scholarship Council (grant no. 201906100127).

Hence, this study adopted a mixed-methods approach including a bibliometric analysis and content analysis to examine emerging themes in the literature on climate change, inequality and poverty, and food insecurity in Africa. The bibliometric data used were retrieved from the Scopus database for the period 2000–2022. The exercise revealed an increasing trend in the number of publications in the field, as well as strong collaboration between African countries. Specifically, most of the leading research was published by Kenyan, USA, and UK institutes. From the analysis, seven themes emerged; namely; (1) the impact of governance and policy on poverty alleviation, nutrition status, and food security; (2) the role of innovation and sustainable agriculture in mitigating climate change in developing countries; (3) integrating gender in evaluations of the impact of climate change on food security and livelihoods in Africa; (4) climate change adaptation among smallholders in building resilience for nutrition; (5) the role of institutions in assisting smallholders mitigate and adapt to climate shocks; (6) inequality, food unavailability, and agricultural production; and (7) gendered impacts of climate-smart agriculture in climate adaptation and mitigation. We also found out that there was a dearth of longitudinal studies on these seven themes. Another key element revealed by the study was the lack of policies that address the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change; hence, there is limited research on the agricultural gender productivity gap. Policies based on the tenants of socio-economic inclusion need to guide the distribution of wealth and economic participation in order to reduce inequality and improve food security and nutrition outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.","bibliometric analysis; climate change; content analysis; food security; inequality; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); VOSviewer","Kenya; United Kingdom; United States; climate change; food security; income; literature review; poverty; Sustainable Development Goal","","","","","","","Reetsch A., Schwarzel K., Dornack C., Stephene S., Feger K., Optimising nutrient cycles to improve food security in smallholder farming families—A case study from banana-coffee-based farming in the kagera region, NW tanzania, Sustainability, 12, (2020); Wanyama J., Banadda N., Kiyimba F., Okurut S., Zziwa A., Kabenge I., Kiggundu N., Profiling agricultural engineering technologies for mechanizing smallholder agriculture in uganda, Agric.

The aim is to provide guidance to EEs on ways to adapt to future external shocks. Design/methodology/approach: As this study is exploratory in nature, the authors use a sequential mixed method whereby a qualitative method is used first to identify emergent themes from in-depth interviews with EE members, followed by a quantitative method (survey) based on those themes across a broader cross section of EE members. Findings: Entrepreneurial ecosystem’s geographical advantages have declined during the pandemic as EE firms adapted to this external shock by developing more digitally distributed organizations. Research limitations/implications: Based on the findings, the authors propose an emerging model of EEs that extends the traditional clustering model focused on geography to account for more digitally distributed entrepreneurial clusters. However, the results, based on an in-depth study of one ecosystem, may not be fully generalizable to all EEs. Practical implications: Given the widespread pandemic impact, the findings may be instructive to EEs and organizations in EEs that aim to become more resilient in the face of potential future external shocks. Social implications: As part of the qualitative interview process the interviewees were asked what they would change in San Francisco Bay Area if they had a magic wand right now. They discussed a variety of inspiring ideas, but the most frequently mentioned was their wish to change the focus of business to solve societal problems with a global citizen mindset (e.g. recycling energy, climate change, income inequality, access to education and funding, inequity, wealth gaps, housing crisis and homelessness) to make the world a better place. Additionally, the pandemic exposed some inequality in work conditions across demographics. As firms reorganize to increase resiliency, attention to these issues should be addressed. Originality/value: This study is unique in applying the PEP to EEs to deepen our understanding about how an EE evolves during periods of sudden external shocks. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Entrepreneurial ecosystem; Pandemic; Punctuated equilibrium paradigm","","","","","","","","Acs Z.J., Szerb L., Entrepreneurship, economic growth and public policy, Small Business Economics, 28, 2-3, pp. 109-122, (2006); Alvedalen J., Boschma R., A critical review of entrepreneurial ecosystems research: towards a future research agenda, European Planning Studies, 25, 6, pp. 887-903, (2017); Audretsch D.B., Have we oversold the Silicon Valley model of entrepreneurship?, Small Business Economics, (2019); Audretsch D.B., Keilbach M.C., Lehmann E.E., Entrepreneurship and Economic Growth, (2006); Baca S.C., Prandi D., Lawrence M.S., Mosquera J.M., Romanel A., Drier Y., Park K., Kitabayashi N., MacDonald T.Y., Ghandi M., Van Allen E., Kryukov G.V., Sboner A., Theurillat J.P., Soong T.D., Nickerson E., Auclair D., Tewari A., Beltran H., Onofrio R.C., Boysen G., Guiducci C., Barbieri C.E., Cibulskis K., Sivachenko A., Carter S.L., Saksena G., Voet D., Ramos A.H., Winckler W., Cipicchio M., Ardlie K., Kantoff P.W., Berger M.F., Gabriel S.B., Golub T.R., Meyerson M., Lander E.S., Elemento O., Getz G., Demichelis F., Rubin M.A., Garraway L.A., Punctuated evolution of prostate cancer genomes, Cell, 153, 3, pp. 666-677, (2013); Bazeley P., A Practical Introduction to Mixed Methods for Business and Management, (2018); Brown R., Mason C., Looking inside the spiky bits: a critical review and conceptualisation of entrepreneurial ecosystems, Small Business Economics, 49, 1, pp. 11-30, (2017); (1941); Cannice M.V., Bell A.H., Metaphors used by venture capitalists: darwinism, architecture and myth, Venture Capital: An International Journal of Entrepreneurial Finance, 12, 1, pp. 1-20, (2010); Chandna A., COVID-19’s impact on startups: assessing the first few months, Forbes, (2020); Chang A., Bordia P., Duck J., Punctuated equilibrium and linear progression: toward a new understanding of group development, Academy of Management Journal, 46, 1, pp. 106-117, (2003); Chiari Y., Cahais V., Galtier N., Delsuc F., Phylogenomic analyses support the position of turtles as the sister group of birds and crocodiles (Archosauria), BMC Biology, 10, 65, (2012); Chomsky N., Explanatory models in linguistics, Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics, 44, pp. 528-550, (1966); Cohen B., Sustainable valley entrepreneurial ecosystems, Business Strategy and the Environment, 15, 1, pp. 1-14, (2006); Contractor F., What does flattening the curve mean?, AIB Insights, (2020); Creswell J.W., Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, (2003); Creswell J.W., Plano C.V., Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, (2007); Cross W.C.H., Graham T.A., Wright N.A., New paradigms in clonal evolution: punctuated equilibrium in cancer, The Journal of Pathology, 240, 2, pp. 126-136, (2016); Daniel J.I., The big idea: how to start an entrepreneurial revolution, Harvard Business Review, 88, pp. 40-56, (2010); Darwin C., On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, (1859); Eesley C.E., Miller W.F., Impact: stanford university’s economic impact via innovation and entrepreneurship, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2017); Eisenhardt K.M., Building theories from case study research, Academy of Management Review, 14, 4, pp. 532-550, (1989); Eisenhardt K.M., Graebner M.E., Theory building from cases: opportunities and challenges, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 1, pp. 25-32, (2007); Eldredge N., Confessions of a darwinist, The Virginia Quarterly Review, 82, pp. 32-53, (2006); Eldredge N., Gould S.J., Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism, Models in Paleobiology, (1972); Gersick C.J.G., Time and transition in work teams: toward a new model of group development, Academy of Management Journal, 31, 1, pp. 9-41, (1988); Gersick C.J.G., Revolutionary change theories: a multilevel exploration of the punctuated equilibrium paradigm, Academy of Management Review, 16, 1, pp. 10-36, (1991); Giones F., Brem A., Pollack J.M., Michaelis T.L., Klyver K., Brinckmann J., Revising entrepreneurial action in response to exogenous shocks: considering the COVID-19 pandemic, Journal of Business Venturing Insights, 14, (2020); Glaser B.G., Strauss A.L., The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies of Qualitative Research, (1967); Goldschmidt R., The Material Basis of Evolution, (1940); Gould S.J., Return of the hopeful monster, Nature History, 86, pp. 22-30, (1977); Gould S.J., Eldredge N., Punctuated equilibrium comes of age, Nature, 366, 6452, pp. 223-227, (1993); Hjalmsdottir A., Bjarnadottir V.S., I have turned into a foreman here at home”.

Nevertheless, little research has focused on how climate policies affect inequality. To address this, we employ a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to quantify the inequality impacts of the Chinese carbon taxes. Our CGE model results show that tax impacts on inequality are influenced by distribution of climate damages, tax payments, and recycling of tax revenues. Specifically, a positive correlation between income and climate damage induces lower inequality, compared to a zero or negative correlation. Tax payments by high-income households induce lower inequality than tax payments proportional to or independent from income. Recycling tax revenues to low-income households only induces lower inequality than the other recycling schemes. The results imply that relative utility is determined by absolute income, whereas income inequality only has a slight impact on it. In other words, governments could reduce negative feelings about inequality under a climate policy by increasing national income, even if the climate policy may induce higher inequality. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Imperial College London","This paper is supported by Imperial College London, and the Article Processing Charge (APC) is funded by Imperial College London.

Governance of each of the five international organizations is outlined: How the organizations were originally structured and financed; how financing relates to the organizational structure and governance; and how the formal and informal voices of members are exercised are discussed, with respect to the choice of leadership and the substantive content of what the organizations do and how. Issues of coordination among the Rome-based agencies, the World Bank, and CGIAR are discussed, given that the world is undergoverned in relation to the challenges of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, confronting climate change, conflict, natural resource degradation, income inequality, persistent poverty, and growing hunger. With greater long-term, core-funding support, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) would be able to translate its guidelines into operations to combat climate change and promote conservation agriculture and its Codex Alimentarius into food safety. With collaboration with the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Bank, FAO can help move fragile countries into rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development.

Our methodological framework was based on the General Equilibrium Analysis of the Brazilian Economy Project—PAEGDyn, a dynamic CGE model. The results show that the projected falls in agricultural productivity impose reductions in the performance of Brazilian GDP over time. Even with the use by other sectors of the economy of the factors unemployed in agriculture, there is no intersectoral compensation in economic production over time able to bring it back to the reference trajectory. In addition, the impact will be greater in warmer and poor regions, which depend on agriculture and present greater income inequality, accentuated by the free mobility of production factors within the national border. Therefore, the main implication of this study is the need to allocate scarce resources for adaptation and mitigation policies primarily for these regions, including broadly stimulating economic development with more income distribution. This will allow these regions to protect themselves by making investments in new technologies and modern infrastructure for the agricultural sector. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agricultural productivity; Climate change; Dynamics CGE models; GTAP; Paegdyn","Brazil; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Economics; Investments; Productivity; Agricultural productivity; Agricultural sector; Economic production; General equilibrium; Income distribution; Methodological frameworks; Modern infrastructure; Reference trajectories; adaptive management; agricultural management; agricultural production; agroindustry; climate change; economic development; Gross Domestic Product; Climate change","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (001); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305807/2018–8, 312975/2017–1, 437907/2016–3)","This research was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico—CNPq (Grant Nos. 437907/2016–3, 312975/2017–1 and 305807/2018–8) and by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil—CAPES (Finance Code 001).

Specifically, we control for a large number of determinants of income disparities detected by extant literature and focus on agriculture as one of the most crucial channels in the climate change-inequality nexus. We find that temperature increases and precipitation anomalies have significant adverse effects on within-country inequality, especially in the presence of larger shares of population in rural areas and of workers in agriculture. We also provide evidence on the lower distributional impact of climate change in economies that are more diversified across value chain activities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Climate change; FDI; Global value chains; Inequality","climate change; climate effect; foreign direct investment; income distribution; precipitation (climatology)","","","","","Department of Economics, Society, Politics, University of Urbino; European International Business Academy; FDIs; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (20177J2LS9)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Department of Economics, Society, Politics, University of Urbino ‘Carlo Bo’ (research project “FDIs and Global Value Chain participation: direct and indirect effects on income inequality”).

Herein, the predominant objectives are: (a) To determine the poverty groups by quintiles through the cattle income in households of small milk producers; (b) To characterize rural livelihoods by using capital theory; and (c) To assess the perception of climate change (CC) and the willingness to accept adaptation as well as mitigation measures. The current study was performed in communities that are located in the Ecuadorian Andes, where some 178 surveys were conducted with indigenous Kichwa and mestizo heads of households. From the total net income determined, five groups were organized. The Lorenz curve was applied as a general indicator of the relative inequality, as well as the Gini coefficient (G). On the basis of the theory of capital, the human, social, natural, physical, and financial characteristics were determined, and seven variables were considered to evaluate the perception and willingness to accept mitigation and adaptation actions of the given quintiles. The result of the Gini coefficient was 0.52, which indicates that the poorest 20% of the population only receives 3.40% of the income, while the richest 20% of the quintile obtain about 54% of the total income. It is evident that most producers know little about CC, but that they are willing to receive strengthening programs. Therefore, it is essential to establish strategic guidelines from public policy in order to reduce inequality and to improve the social welfare of producers, with a transversal axis in the strengthening of the capacities on the impact, mitigation, and adaptation to CC, as well as the provision of several tools, such as access to climate information. © 2022 by the authors.

Decision-making for sustainable development is multifaceted and interlinked, owing to the diverse interests of different stakeholders and political conflicts. Analysing a situation from all social, political, environmental, and economic perspectives is necessary to achieve balanced growth and facilitate sustainable development. South Korea was among the poorest countries following the Korean War; however, it has developed rapidly since 1955. This growth was not limited to economic development alone, and the chronology of South Korean development may serve as a reference for development in other countries. Here, we explore the compressed growth of South Korea using a narrative approach and time-series, comparative, and spatial analyses. Developmental indicators, along with the modern history of South Korea, are introduced to explain the reasons for compressed growth. The development of the mid-latitude region comprising 46 countries in this study, where nearly half of Earth’s population resides, was compared with that of South Korea; results show that the developmental chronology of South Korea can serve as a reference for national development in this region. © 2021 by the authors.

In doing so, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Nepal has been developed, incorporating the allocation of land for several agricultural crops, including the major staple foods, with specification of a nested set of constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functional forms. The set of land transformation elasticities facilitates switching from one crop to another; based on their agronomic characteristics and degree of climate change impacts. Using Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data and Living Standard Survey (LSS) data, a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Nepal is developed and used to simulate three scenarios of climate change and land reallocation. The simulation results in the long run depict farmers as more likely to use land for crops that are comparatively less impacted by climate change, such as paddy. The results further show that land reallocation reduces the income inequality and poverty among rural and urban households by significantly controlling the income losses of marginal farmers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change adaptation;

This study examines the drivers of renewable energy consumption (REC) and the nexus between GDP growth, technological innovation, gross fixed capital formation, CO2 emissions, income inequality, and renewable energy consumption (REC) using annual data from BRICS countries. To this end, the study uses the augmented mean group (AMG) estimator, a second-generation estimator that takes slope homogeneity and cross-sectional dependence into consideration. For robustness, the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator has also been utilized. The findings of both estimators indicate that carbon emissions, technological innovation, and gross fixed capital formation exert adverse and significant impacts on REC. The findings also show that the use of renewable energy will rise as income inequality declines. We also employ the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (DH) granger causality test. The results of the analysis demonstrate a one-way causal association between income inequality and REC. This finding confirms that a reduction in income inequality will have a major impact on the adoption of renewable energy sources. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AMG technique; BRICS economies; Income inequality; Renewable energy; Technological innovation","Carbon Dioxide; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Development; Inventions; Renewable Energy; Brazil; China; India; Russian Federation; South Africa; Climate change; Economic analysis; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; carbon dioxide; Augmented mean group technique; BRICS economy; Economic growths; Energy needs; Future energies; Group technique; Income inequality; Renewable energies; Renewable energy consumption; Technological innovation; alternative energy; capital formation; carbon emission; climate change; energy use; Gross Domestic Product; income; innovation; cross-sectional study; economic development; invention; renewable energy; Renewable energy","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, ","","","","","Abbasi K.R., Adedoyin F.F., Abbas J., Hussain K., The impact of energy depletion and renewable energy on CO2 emissions in Thailand: fresh evidence from the novel dynamic ARDL simulation, Renewable Energy, 180, pp. 1439-1450, (2021); Adams S., Klobodu E.K.M., Apio A., Renewable and non-renewable energy, regime type and economic growth, Renewable Energy, 125, pp. 755-767, (2018); Ahmad U.S., Usman M., Hussain S., Jahanger A., Abrar M., Determinants of renewable energy sources in Pakistan: An overview, Environ Sci Pollut Res, pp. 1-19, (2022); Alam M.M., Murad M.W., The impacts of economic growth, trade openness and technological progress on renewable energy use in organization for economic co-operation and development countries, Renewable Energy, 145, pp. 382-390, (2020); Al-Mulali U., Solarin S.A., Sheau-Ting L., Ozturk I., Does moving towards renewable energy cause water and land inefficiency?

Six hundred farm households from Mymensingh division were used as the source of data for the current study. The results of the analysis show that per capita income difference is significant in farm household among the districts, and agricultural income variation play an important role in per capita income. Higher income from agriculture contributed lower income inequality in the districts, even though employment income is dominant in most of the districts and highest income inequality is found in Netrokona district. Rice is the leading crop in most of districts, except Mymensingh where income share of other crops is high in the total agricultural income. Remittance income shows the higher income inequality among the districts that are lowest in employment and then agriculture. Agriculture is a primary contributor of inducing income disparity of farm households. In this context, we found that the key variation of agricultural income comes from aman HYV and boro HYV rice crops. The cost and income of these rice crops was largely calculated based on the enhanced yields, higher irrigation, and chemical fertilizer and hired labor use per hectare land. By using the lognormal distribution under two scenarios (baseline, yield loss), we estimated the poverty rates resulted from the yield loss of rice production due to potential climate change impact in different districts. The unexpected yield loss of rice by climate change impact leads to the projection that poverty rates in Jamalpur and Netrokona districts would increase. It is, therefore, recommended that proper management of agricultural farms, crop diversification, and appropriate technology interventions are necessary to reduce income inequality and losses of farm income from climate change impact. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Farm income; Inequality; Poverty","Bangladesh; Mymensingh [Bangladesh]; Agricultural robots; Crops; Fertilizers; Agricultural crops; Appropriate technologies; Chemical fertilizers; Climate change impact; Crop diversification; Log-normal distribution; Per capita income; Vulnerability assessments; appropriate technology; assessment method; climate change; crop plant; flood; poverty; vulnerability; Climate change","","","","","","","Poverty and Climate Change, Reducing the Vulnerability of the Poor through Adaptation, (2002); Ahmed S., Diffenbaugh N., Hertel T., Climate volatility deepens poverty vulnerability in developing countries, Environmental Research Letters, 4, (2009); Ahmed S., Diffenbaugh N., Hertel T., Lobell D., Ramankutty N., Rios A., Rowhani P., Climate volatility and poverty vulnerability in Tanzania, Global Environmental Change, 21, 1, pp. 46-55, (2011); Climate change and agricultural food production of Bangladesh: An impact assessment using GIS-based biophysical crop simulation model, Center for Spatial Information Science, (2000); Akter J., Sarker M.H., Popescu I., Roelvink D., Evolution of the Bengal Delta and its prevailing processes, Journal of Coastal Research, 32, 5, pp. 1212-1226, (2016); Alamgir M.S., Furuya J., Kobayashi S., Determinants of early cropping of rice in Bangladesh: An assessment as a strategy of avoiding cyclone risk, Japanese Journal of Agricultural Economics, 19, pp. 27-30, (2017); Alamgir M.S., Furuya J., Kobayashi S., Binte M.R., Salam M.A., Farmers’ net income distribution and regional vulnerability to climate change: An empirical study of Bangladesh, Climate, 6, 3, (2018); Alauddin M., Sarker M.A.R., Climate change and farm-level adaptation decisions and strategies in drought-prone and groundwater-depleted areas of Bangladesh: An empirical investigation, Ecological Economics, 106, C, pp. 204-213, (2014); Building climate resilience in the agriculture sector in Asia and the Pacific, (2009); Planning commission, (2018); National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh (Vol. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7), the Revised Edition, (2003); Basak J.K., Ali M.A., Islam M.N., Alam M.J.B., Assessment of the effect of climate change on Boro rice production in Bangladesh using CERES-Rice model, In Proceedings of the International Conference on Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Strategies for Bangladesh, pp. 103-113, (2009); Basak J.K., Ali M.A., Islam M.N., Rashid M.A., Assessment of the effect of climate change on Boro Rice Production in Bangladesh using DSSAT model, Journal of Civil Engineering (IEB), 38, 2, pp. 95-108, (2010); Yearbook of agricultural statistics of Bangladesh, (2011); Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, (2015); Household income and expenditure survey, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, (2017); Statistical Year Book Bangladesh-38Th Series, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, (2018); Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics-30Th Series.

This research introduces the Great Recession Index (GRI), a place-based composite measure that captures the multidimensional nature of the GR. The GRI can be used to examine macro-level outcomes and is especially well-suited for examining the spatial variation and longterm effects of the GR. The GRI is adaptable to a variety of geospatial units of analysis, and in this article, we develop measures for countries, U.S. states, and U.S. metropolitan areas. Then, using the state-based GRI, we provide a research application to demonstrate the utility of the GRI for explaining state-level income inequality in the post-Recession period. The results show that the initial shock of the GR decreased the income share of upper-class households, but the aftershock of the Recession increased their income share, resulting in increased income inequality in the U.S. since the Recession. This paper concludes by considering the feasibility of using similar measures for evaluating the effects of catastrophic events such as wars, civil unrest, climate change, natural disasters, or pestilence on societal outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Great Recession; Great Recession Index; Income inequality; Longitudinal and spatial measures of economic downturns","United States; economic conditions; income; index method; long-term change; macroeconomics; socioeconomic indicator; spatial variation","","","","","","","Brooks C., Manza J., A broken public?

Micro-level diversity, decentralized interaction, self-organization, adaptation and learning, emergence, and evolution, are some of the fundamental features that the above entities share and that allow to classify them as being complex entities. In a complex economic system, existing structures of interaction are in constant mutation as individual agents contact and influence one another and, by doing so, reshape the macro environment in which socio-economic relations unfold. Notwithstanding the observed pervasiveness of complexity in economics, there are a few areas of economic thought where the discussion on the theme has gained an exceptional relevance. In this article, six of such areas are identified and their complex nature is highlighted and scrutinized. These pertain to: (i) Knowledge interactions and technological innovation; (ii) Corporate design and organizational learning; (iii) Public policies directed at market regulation; (iv) Banking and financial markets; (v) Environmental economics, sustainability, and climate change; and (vi) income inequality. © 2020, The Editorial Office of JSSC & Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Agent-based models; complex networks; complex systems; emergent phenomena; evolutionary nature; market regulation; public policies","Climate change; Commerce; Environmental regulations; Adaptation and learning; Environmental economics; Fundamental features; Government institutions; Knowledge interaction; Organizational learning; Self organizations; Technological innovation; Sustainable development","","","","","ISCAL; Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa; Portuguese National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UID/SOC/04521/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This research was supported by the Portuguese National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology (FCT), under the Project UID/SOC/04521/2020, and by the Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa as a part of the IPL/2019/MacroVirtu/ISCAL and IPL/2020/MacroRates/ISCAL Projects.

The factors that have a retarding effect on the dynamics of global political processes include the following: growing income inequality and social stratification within most countries of the world; the erosion of democracy and the decline in popularity of the Western liberal model of development as a reference model; the growth of support for populism policies; the conflict between globalization and the national interests of the State, especially exacerbated during the pandemic; the policy of protectionism; the crisis of global governance; the spread of ideas of anti-globalism. These factors provoke the trend of globalization. Factors that influence the acceleration of the dynamics of global political processes: increasing inequality between countries and intensifying competition between them; digitalization; an increase in the number and aggravation of global problems, among which climate change occupies a special place; the crisis in the field of global health (all this shows the need for integration and cooperation of countries to overcome them); global migration; expansion of the number of non-state actors; the emergence of the phenomenon of hybrid warfare and the changing nature of conflicts; a new concept of security; the expansion of global consciousness and the ideology of globalism; the idea of multipolarity. These factors prevail in the overall balance and give rise to a tendency of accelerated movement towards a multipolar polycentric world. The interaction of these two groups of factors generates an unstable and nonlinear nature of the dynamics of global political processes. The most important consequence of the acceleration of the dynamics of global political processes is the gradual emergence of a new configuration of the geopolitical landscape and the transformation of the global geopolitical space, the change in the ratio of geopolitical forces and the shift of the center of gravity from West to East. © 2022 Ltd ""Integration: Education and Science"".

This is particularly evident in regions across the “dust belt” – i.e., from the west coast of North Africa to China, over the Sahara, the Middle East, Central and South Asia. Agriculture is influenced by dust storms more than other economic sectors because of its necessary interactions with, and dependence on, the environment. This study explores the effect of dust storms on Iranian barley farmers' livelihood. The study area has been increasingly affected by dust storms originating from other countries on the dust belt. Our results indicate that these storms have a negative and significant effect on barley farmers' net revenues during the years 2000–2016. We find that a one hour increase in dust occurrence reduces barley farmers' income, from irrigated barley and rain-fed barley, by US$ 0.36 and US$ 0.08 per hectare, respectively. The findings have important implications regarding the income inequality effects of climate change; those significantly affected by dust storms are often small-scale farmers whose livelihood depends on the income from very few acres of land. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate Change; Dust Storms; Income Inequality; Ricardian Rent","Central Asia; China; Middle East; North Africa; Sahara; South Asia; Hordeum; barley; climate change; dust storm; economic activity; income; livelihood","","","","","Hossein Asakereh; University of Alberta, UofA; University of Tehran, UT; University of Waterloo, UW; University of Zanjan, ZNU","The authors would like to thank Sven Anders (University of Alberta), Jennifer Clapp (University of Waterloo), Ali Darvishi Boloorani (University of Tehran), and Hossein Asakereh (University of Zanjan) for their insightful comments and feedback on previous versions of this article.

Computing impulse response functions (IRFs) from the local projections’ method, we empirically show that there is an immediate temporary positive response in income inequality from rising temperatures within the first year. We also observe differences in the effects of temperature growth on inequality across different classifications, mainly states with high inequality and low temperature growth are more susceptible to changes in temperature growth than states with already high temperature growth and high inequality growth. States with low inequality growth exhibit similar positive effects on income inequality across low- and high-temperature-growth classifications. We find that the initial positive effect on income inequality is not permanent. However, if the effects of rising temperatures are unabated in the earlier periods, income inequality starts to rise in the later periods. Our results highlight an important pathway, that climate change can negatively affect sustainable development through increased income inequality. © 2023 by the authors.","climate change; income inequality; temperatures; United States","United States; climate change; high temperature; income distribution; low temperature; sustainable development","","","","","","","Cai Y., Lontzek T.S., The social cost of carbon with economic and climate risks, J.

The management of cassava cultivation certainly has risks that can occur from natural factors, such as climate, weather, floods, as well as pests and diseases, during the cultivation process, price risks, etc., and ultimately will have an impact on farmers' income. Cassava risk analysis due to climate change is an interesting topic to research because it can cause huge losses that affect farmers' incomes and income inequality of cassava farmers. The study aims to (1) identifies the impact of climate change on cassava farming, (2) analyze the income of cassava farmers as a result of climate change, (2) analyze the risks of cassava farming from the impacts of climate change. The research method used is a survey with purposive sampling in the determination of sub-districts and villages, selected Ngadirojo Subdistrict, cassava farmers took 60 farmers in simple random sampling. Data were analyzed with descriptive analysis, frequency analysis, revenue analysis, and risk analysis. The results showed that there was a 12.43% change in income due to climate change as measured by the delay in the growing season and product quality. There is a change in quality and quantity in three types of cassava market in Wonogiri Regency, namely (1) wet cassava market, (2) dry cassava market (gaplek), (3) industrial market that goes directly into the factory. Risk analysis obtained coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.503 which means that the average income risk faced by farmers is classified as risky in the low category (CV>0.5), with the lower limit value (La) showing Rp. 28,121.82 which means that in running a cassava cultivation business, farmers must dare to bear the risk of income of Rp. 28,121.82 (12.47%) in one period of cultivation.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Commerce; Cultivation; Plants (botany); Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Coefficient of variation; Cultivation process; Descriptive analysis; Frequency Analysis; Geographical conditions; Industrial markets; Revenue distributions; Simple random sampling; Climate change","","","","","","","Analisis komoditas pertanian subsektor tanaman pangan, (2015); Wargiono J, Hasanuddin A, Suyamto, Teknologi produksi ubi kayu mendukung industri bioetanol, (2006); Widaningsih R, Outlook komoditas pertanian tanaman pangan ubi kayu, (2016); Wargiono J, Saraswati Pasaribu J, Sutoro, Prosiding seminar pengkajian dan pengembangan teknologi pra dan pascapanen ubi kayu 2, (1990); Sosrosoedirdjo R S, Bercocok tanam ketela pohon, (1993); Husain T K, Mulyo J H, Jamhari, Analisis perbandingan keuntungan dan risiko usaha perikanan rakyat sistem monokultur dan polikultur di Kabupaten Pangkep, Jurnal Agro Ekonomi, 27, pp. 136-149, (2016); Darwis K, Ilmu usahatani teori dan penerapan, (2017); Yasa I W W, Dharma I G B, dan Sudipta I G K, Manajemen risiko operasional dan pemeliharaan tempat pembuangan akhir (TPA) regional Bangli di Kabupaten Bangli Jurnal Spektran, 1, pp. 30-38, (2013); Ekaria, Muhammad M, Analisis Risiko Usahatani Ubi Kayu di Desa Gorua Kecamatan Tobelo Utara Agrikan, Jurnal Agribisnis Perikanan, 11, pp. 9-14, (2018)","E.S.

However, intercity comparisons and responsibility allocations among cities are hindered because cost- and time-effective methods to calculate the carbon footprints of global cities have yet to be developed. Here, we establish a hybrid method integrating top-down input–output analysis and bottom-up crowdsourced data to estimate the carbon footprints of global cities. Using city purchasing power as the main predictor of the carbon footprint, we estimate the carbon footprints of 465 global cities in 2020. Those cities comprise 10% of the global population but account for 18% of the global carbon emissions showing a significant concentration of carbon emissions. The Gini coefficients are applied to show that global carbon inequality is less than income inequality. In addition, the increased carbon emissions that come from high consumption lifestyles offset the carbon reduction by efficiency gains that could result from compact city design and large city scale. Large climate benefits could be obtained by achieving a low-carbon transition in a small number of global cities, emphasizing the need for leadership from globally important urban centres. © 2022 The Author(s)","Carbon accounting; Carbon neutrality; Consumption-based emissions; Input-output analysis; Responsible consumption; Sustainable cities","","","","","","","","Pincetl S., Cities are not isolates: to reduce their impacts a change in urban-rural interdependencies and the direction of modernity are required, Adv Appl Energy, (2022); Jing R., Wang X., Zhao Y., Zhou Y., Wu J., Lin J., Planning urban energy systems adapting to extreme weather, Adv Appl Energy, 3, (2021); Lombardi M., Laiola E., Tricase C., Rana R., Assessing the urban carbon footprint: an overview, Environ Impact Assess Rev, 66, pp. 43-52, (2017); Nutkiewicz A., Choi B., Jain R.K., Exploring the influence of urban context on building energy retrofit performance: a hybrid simulation and data-driven approach, Adv Appl Energy, 3, (2021); Cozzi L., Gould T., Bouckart S., Crow D., Kim T.Y., Mcglade C., Et al., World energy outlook 2020, (2020); Hsu A., Tan J., Ng Y.M., Toh W., Vanda R., Goyal N., Performance determinants show European cities are delivering on climate mitigation, Nat Clim Chang, 10, pp. 1015-1022, (2020); Smeds E., Acuto M., Networking Cities after Paris: weighing the Ambition of Urban Climate Change Experimentation, Glob Policy, 9, pp. 549-559, (2018); Wiedmann T., Chen G., Owen A., Lenzen M., Doust M., Barrett J., Et al., Three-scope carbon emission inventories of global cities, J Ind Ecol, 25, pp. 735-750, (2021); Zhou Y., Chen M., Tang Z., Zhao Y., City-level carbon emissions accounting and differentiation integrated nighttime light and city attributes, Resour Conserv Recycl, 182, (2022); Shan Y., Guan D., Liu J., Mi Z., Liu Z., Liu J., Et al., Methodology and applications of city level CO2 emission accounts in China, J Clean Prod, 161, pp. 1215-1225, (2017); Hoornweg D., Sugar L., Trejos Gomez C.L., Cities and greenhouse gas emissions: moving forward, Environ Urban, 23, pp. 207-227, (2011); Chen S., Long H., Chen B., Feng K., Hubacek K., Urban carbon footprints across scale: important considerations for choosing system boundaries, Appl Energy, 259, (2020); Mi Z., Zhang Y., Guan D., Shan Y., Liu Z., Cong R., Et al., Consumption-based emission accounting for Chinese cities, Appl Energy, 184, pp. 1073-1081, (2016); Lee J., Taherzadeh O., Kanemoto K., The scale and drivers of carbon footprints in households, cities and regions across India, Glob Environ Chang, 66, (2021); Li X., Zhang R., Chen J., Jiang Y., Zhang Q., Long Y., Urban-scale carbon footprint evaluation based on citizen travel demand in Japan, Appl Energy, 286, (2021); Kanemoto K., Shigetomi Y., Hoang N.T., Okuoka K., Moran D., Spatial variation in household consumption-based carbon emission inventories for 1200 Japanese cities, Environ Res Lett, 15, (2020); Hsu A., Wang X., Tan J., Toh W., Goyal N., (2022); Wang G., Han Q., de Vries B., A geographic carbon emission estimating framework on the city scale, J Clean Prod, 244, (2020); Kongboon R., Gheewala S.H., Sampattagul S., Greenhouse gas emissions inventory data acquisition and analytics for low carbon cities, J Clean Prod, 343, (2022); Huo D., Huang X., Dou X., Ciais P., Li Y., Deng Z., Et al., Carbon Monitor Cities, near-real-time daily estimates of CO2 emissions from 1500 cities worldwide, ArXiv Preprint ArXiv:220407836, (2022); Nangini C., Peregon A., Ciais P., Weddige U., Vogel F., Wang J., Et al., A global dataset of CO2 emissions and ancillary data related to emissions for 343 cities, Sci Data, 6, pp. 1-29, (2019); Moran D., Kanemoto K., Jiborn M., Wood R., Tobben J., Seto K.C., Carbon footprints of 13 000 cities, Environ Res Lett, 13, (2018); Marcotullio P.J., Sarzynski A., Albrecht J., Schulz N., A Top-Down Regional Assessment of Urban Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Europe, Ambio, 43, pp. 957-968, (2014); Guo X., Chai R., Yao Y., Mi Y., Wang Y., Feng T., Et al., Comprehensive Analysis of the COVID-19: based on the Social-Related Indexes From NUMBEO, Front Public Health, 10, (2022); Carlsen L., Bruggemann R., Environmental perception in 33 European countries: an analysis based on partial order, Environ Dev Sustain, 22, pp. 1873-1896, (2020); Shu Z., Carrasco R.A., Garcia-Miguel J.P., Sanchez-Montanes M., Multiple Scenarios of Quality of Life Index Using Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifiers: the Case of 85 Countries in Numbeo, Mathematics, 10, (2022); Jones C.M., Wheeler S.M., Kammen D.M., Carbon Footprint Planning: quantifying Local and State Mitigation Opportunities for 700 California Cities, Urban Plan, 3, pp. 35-51, (2018); Gill B., Moeller S., GHG Emissions and the Rural-Urban Divide.

While research in this area generally finds significant positive associations between working hours and various environmental outcomes, one question that remains unexamined is how other structural factors might shape this relationship. This study advances research on the environmental consequences of working hours by considering how inequality moderates the relationship between average working hours and CO2 emissions across US states from 2005 to 2015. Integrating arguments from literatures on the environmental consequences of inequality and working hours, I propose that inequality amplifies the effects of working hours on emissions by increasing the overall scale of consumption and shaping the composition of that consumption to be more environmentally intensive. Results of two-way fixed-effects regression models provide support for this proposition. The findings indicate that the effects of average working hours on emissions increase in magnitude at higher levels of inequality. This study advances the understanding of the mechanisms behind working time and inequality that shape emissions. The findings also suggest that policies aimed at reducing inequality while simultaneously reducing pressures for longer working hours are likely to be socially and ecologically beneficial while also potentially mitigating the possibility of rebound effects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Consumption; Emissions; Income inequality; Working hours","","","","","","","","Chappell B., 4-Day Workweek Boosted Workers’ Productivity By 40%, (2019); (2021); Farzan A.N., Spain Will Experiment with Four-Day Workweek, a First for Europe, Washington Post, (2021); (2019); Lin S., Want to work only 32 hours a week?, (2020); Kelly J., California Congressman Mark Takano Introduces Legislation For A Four-Day Workweek, Forbes, (2021); (2019); Fitzgerald J.B., Schor J.B., Jorgenson A.K., (2018); Fremstad A., Paul M., Underwood A., Work Hours and CO2 Emissions: Evidence from U.S. Households, Rev.

Agriculture is expected to contribute more, but is under pressure in both high-income and developing countries to do so more sustainably and inclusively. This paper reviews the roles of food policy in this changing setting. It begins by revisiting the case for keeping food markets open to international trade, investment and technology transfer, and concludes that openness is even more important, especially for developing countries, as the climate becomes warmer and more volatile. It then summarizes trade-related food policy developments globally in the 50 years prior to the global financial crisis, and in the price-spike periods since then. The current situation is calling for more action – including from agriculture – to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. The scope for re-purposing food policies to better meet these demands is then assessed. It proposes some alternatives to current measures that could better achieve national societal objectives while simultaneously benefitting the rest of the world in terms of easing natural resource and environmental stresses and reducing national and global poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and inequalities in income, wealth and health. The review concludes by noting areas where further research could facilitate such transformations in food policies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Re-purposing food policies; Uncertain international trade environment; Virtues of liberal food trade","climate effect; food availability; food market; food policy; international trade; investment; technology transfer","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., (2021); Aghion P., Antonin C., Brunel S., The Power of Creative Destruction: Economic Upheaval and the Wealth of Nations, (2021); Akcigit U., Melitz M.J., (2021); Alcala F., Ciccone A., Trade and Productivity, Quart.

The objective of this paper is to assess the amount, structure, and intensity of total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) related to Mexican household consumption by income level by means of an Input-Output analysis. Our study produced the following three main findings: 1) Large carbon inequality among household income groups, with the bottom household decile emitting 2.7% of the total CO2e emissions, and the top decile emitting 26.8%. 2) Three needs are the main drivers of carbon emissions of Mexican households: transportation (39.9%), dwelling energy consumption (26.9%), and food (15.2%). The share of transportation (public and private) is higher when the households are in higher deciles (24% in the bottom decile vs 40% in the top decile). Private transportation in the top decile is of particular concern. The CO2e emissions from private transport from the richest decile represent more than 10% of the total CO2e emissions. 3) The total carbon intensity of the household expenditure is depicted in an obtuse inverted U curve as a function of income distribution. The top and the bottom deciles present the lowest carbon intensities because of the composition of their basket of consumer goods and services. In the top decile, there is a significant share of expenditure on financial and educational services (with low carbon intensity), while in the bottom decile there is a high proportion of low-carbon basic products such as food. From all these results, we concluded that, in order to be effective and sustainable from a social and economic point of view, the formulation of policy to mitigate GHG must take into account both household income inequality and the diverse quantity and structure of consumption as a function of income level. © 2020 International Energy Initiative","Climate change; Household consumption; Inequality; Input-output analysis","Mexico [North America]; Carbon; Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Educational services; Household Consumption; Household expenditure; Income distribution; Income inequality; Input output analysis; Private transport; Private transportation; carbon emission; climate change; greenhouse gas; household income; income distribution; input-output analysis; Greenhouse gases","","","","","","","Aall C., Hille J., Consumption – a missing dimension in climate policy, Interdisciplinarity and climate change.

How is the rule of law related to the purpose of the modern corporation?. Research Findings/Insights: We study the role of rule of law in enabling corporations to enhance economic prosperity and diminish income inequality across the globe. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we provide empirical evidence on the role of rule of law in enhancing economic prosperity and diminishing income inequality across the globe. Next, we draw on the law and finance literature and the finance and growth literature to highlight the role of rule of law in enabling corporations to be the major driver of a country's economic growth. Specifically, rule of law is necessary for a citizenry's belief in secure private property rights, which gives the citizenry confidence to invest in physical capital, human capital, and innovation—the three catalysts of economic growth. Also, the rule of law allows for an effective judiciary that can enforce legal contracts. Shareholder reliance on limited liability and debtholder rights originate from the legal contracts among shareholders, debtholders, and other stakeholders. This highlights the importance of rule of law in enabling companies to raise equity and debt financing, leading to financial development. Given this background on the role of the rule of law in the issuance of equity capital to provide financial resources to corporations, we analyze the current debate among policymakers, corporate leaders, institutional investors, and social activists on the purpose of the modern corporation. We conclude that the modern corporation should maximize long-term shareholder value, while conforming to the law of the land. Practitioner/Policy Implications: At the national and international level, policymakers should focus on improving rule of law—this enhances economic prosperity and diminishes income inequality. At the individual country level, we suggest steps to align shareholder wealth maximization with stakeholder interests: first, antitrust public policies should be vigorously enforced to maintain and enhance competition in product markets and labor markets. Second, management and board compensation should be reformed to focus on creating and sustaining long-term shareholder value. Finally, for many of society's more serious problems, corporations do not represent the appropriate level of action. Climate change, for example, poses significant challenges for societies and businesses. But significant changes to combat climate change require public policy changes in the United States and abroad. Turning more to corporations because the political process seems broken will not do. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","","","","Sofia Johan","We thank Sofia Johan, the guest editor, for the constructive comments.","Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J.A., The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation, American Economic Review, 91, pp. 1369-1401, (2001); Appel I.R., Gormley T.A., Keim D.B., Passive investors, not passive owners, Journal of Financial Economics, 121, 1, pp. 111-141, (2016); Bae K.-H., El Ghoul S., Gong Z.J., Guedhami O., Does CSR matter in times of crisis?

However, to date, the distributional impacts of these futures have been neglected, leaving open crucial questions about living standards and inequality. Using the lens of ‘decent living energy’, this article begins to piece together the puzzle by providing a distributional analysis of a recent low-energy-demand, net-zero scenario for the UK. We find that if the UK succeeded in following a low-energy pathway, but income and energy inequality continued increasing at the current rate, 9 million people could lack sufficient energy for meeting decent living standards in 2050. Theoretically, this can be mitigated either by achieving considerable reductions in income inequality, or by ensuring highly energy-efficient technologies are available at all income levels as this reduces the energy required to meet decent living standards. Reviewing various specific policies that could forge a low-energy-demand future, we find some are inherently equitable and others can easily be designed to be so. However, policies could also prove regressive in numerous ways. We thus argue that an equitable, socially-just, low-energy-demand policy pathway would need to be responsive and dynamic, bold and targeted, and joined-up with respect to both policy implementation and assessment. © 2022 The Authors","Climate change; Decent living standards; Energy demand; Energy justice; Energy poverty; Inequality; Just transitions","","","","","","","","Grubler A., Wilson C., Bento N., Boza-Kiss B., Krey V., McCollum D.L., Rao N.D., Riahi K., Rogelj J., De Stercke S., Cullen J., Frank S., Fricko O., Guo F., Gidden M., Havlik P., Huppmann D., Kiesewetter G., Rafaj P., Schoepp W., Valin H., A low energy demand scenario for meeting the 1.5 °C target and sustainable development goals without negative emission technologies, Nat.

The social, environmental, economic, political, and technological fields are the main subjects of these changes. However, our understanding and comprehension of these situations are restricted which brings failure in forecasts and projections for the subject. While certainty implies a clear knowledge of reality, doubt suggests a surreal grasp of reality. “The Age of Uncertainty” is driven by a range of complicated, interdependent, and ever-changing variables. According to some scholars, investment, macroeconomic and microeconomic factors, stock market volatility, and income inequality generate economic uncertainty. Environmental issues, particularly climate change, which threaten the future of humanity and the natural world are one of the contributing elements to “the age of uncertainty.” Climate change threatens infrastructure, biodiversity, economic stability, and human health. Extreme weather events, such as floods, heat waves, storms, and droughts, cause economic losses and infrastructural damage. Taking into account of the above-mentioned factors, triggering uncertainty, the chapter begins with a theoretical analysis of the Age of Uncertainty. The second part will analyse environmental uncertainty, focusing specifically on climate change and its impact on human migration. The third part examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on climate-driven migration and the government’s reaction to this issue. The fourth part examines the problems that policymakers confront in addressing these issues. The fifth part will present strategies for enhancing resilience and modifying policymaking to face the problems of the age of uncertainty more effectively. The conclusion will argue that reinventing our relationship with uncertainty and change is essential for designing a fairer and more sustainable future. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","","","","","","","","","Adger W.N., Quinn T., Lorenzoni I., Murphy C., Sweeney J., Thomas D.S., Changing social contracts in climate-change adaptation, Nature Climate Change, 8, 11, pp. 330-333, (2018); Ahmed F., Ahmed N.U., Pissarides C., Stiglitz J.E., Why inequality could spread COVID-19, The Lancet Public Health, 5, 5, (2020); Al-Thaqeb S.A., Algharabali B.G., Economic policy uncertainty: A literature review, The Journal of Economic Asymmetries, 20, 100, pp. 1-11, (2019); Biermann F., Boas I., Marchesi V., Global governance by goal-setting: The novel approach of the UN climate summit 2014, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, pp. 26-31, (2017); Clement V., Rigaud K.K., De Sherbinin A., Jones B., Adamo S., Schewe J., Sadiq N., Shabahat E., Groundswell part 2: Acting on internal climate migration, (2021); Connolly-Boutin L., Smit B., Climate change, food security, and livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa, Regional Environmental Change, 16, pp. 385-399, (2016); Dhungana N., Human dignity and cross-border migrants in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, World Development, 136, 105174, pp. 1-4, (2020); Faber D., Schlegel C., Give me shelter from the storm: Framing the climate refugee crisis in the context of neoliberal capitalism, Capitalism Nature Socialism, 28, 3, pp. 1-17, (2017); Foster J.B., The ecological revolution: Making peace with the planet, (2009); Galbraith J.K., The age of uncertainty.

Here I estimate the global inequality of individual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1990 and 2019 using a newly assembled dataset of income and wealth inequality, environmental input-output tables and a framework differentiating emissions from consumption and investments. In my benchmark estimates, I find that the bottom 50% of the world population emitted 12% of global emissions in 2019, whereas the top 10% emitted 48% of the total. Since 1990, the bottom 50% of the world population has been responsible for only 16% of all emissions growth, whereas the top 1% has been responsible for 23% of the total. While per-capita emissions of the global top 1% increased since 1990, emissions from low- and middle-income groups within rich countries declined. Contrary to the situation in 1990, 63% of the global inequality in individual emissions is now due to a gap between low and high emitters within countries rather than between countries. Finally, the bulk of total emissions from the global top 1% of the world population comes from their investments rather than from their consumption. These findings have implications for contemporary debates on fair climate policies and stress the need for governments to develop better data on individual emissions to monitor progress towards sustainable lifestyles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Carbon; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Global emissions; Global inequalities; Greenhouse gas emissions; Income inequality; Input-output table; Low incomes; Middle incomes; Per capita; Wealth inequality; World population; Climate change","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science, LSE; Harvard Kennedy School and Sciences Po seminars; UNPD; Paris School of Economics; European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (856455); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, (00093806); United Nations Development Programme, UNDP","I thank F.

We emphasize the importance of a balanced growth path and show that the lack of such a path is closely related to the slow development of green technologies in environmental economics and to growing inequality in labor economics.

However, the extraction of these mineral resources poses several environmental concerns. This article aims to evaluate the effects of mineral resources, energy intensity, urbanization, and economic development on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and test the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. For this purpose, this study sampled 33 African mineral resources endowed countries with available data from 1990 to 2015. The empirical analysis focused on the main panel and its subpanels—low income (LI), lower middle income (LMI), upper middle income (UMI) panels—to capture the income inequality effects. We employed the heterogeneous fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares models to generate robust and reliable long-run parameters. The estimation results suggest that mineral resources endowment worsens carbon diffusion in the panel countries, such as LI, LMI, and overall. Similarly, energy intensity increases CO2 emissions for LMI, UMI and overall panels. As for urbanization, it has a bicephalous inference that harms the environment at the panel level of LI countries while it decarbonizes at the level of LMI, UMI, and overall panels. The LI, UMI, and overall panels support a U-shaped curve rather than an EKC. Moreover, CO2 emissions have a feedback Granger causality relationship with all its determinants. The findings have useful policy insights for green policy. © 2022, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","Africa; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; DOLS; Environmental Kuznets curve; FMOLS; Mineral resources","","","","","","","","Adams S., Boateng E., Acheampong A.O., Transport energy consumption and environmental quality: Does urbanization matter?, Science of the Total Environment, 744, (2020); Solidification and stabilization of wastes using Portland cement (No. EB071. 02W), 2nd edition edited by Charles M, pp. 1-16, (1998); Adedoyin F., Abubakar I., Bekun F.V., Sarkodie S.A., Generation of energy and environmental-economic growth consequences: Is there any difference across transition economies?, Energy Reports, 6, pp. 1418-1427, (2020); Adom P.K., An evaluation of energy efficiency performances in Africa under heterogeneous technologies, Journal of Cleaner Production, 209, pp. 1170-1181, (2019); Adusah-Poku F., Carbon dioxide emissions, urbanization and population: Empirical evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, Energy Economics Letters, 3, 1, pp. 1-16, (2016); G., 1556, (1950); Ali W., Abdullah A., Azam M., The dynamic relationship between structural change and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Malaysia: A cointegrating approach, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24, 14, pp. 12723-12739, (2017); Alola A.A., Bekun F.V., Sarkodie S.A., Dynamic impact of trade policy, economic growth, fertility rate, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on ecological footprint in Europe, Science of the Total Environment, 685, pp. 702-709, (2019); Alova G., (2018); Alvarez-Herranz A., Balsalobre D., Cantos J.M., Shahbaz M., Energy innovations-GHG emissions nexus: Fresh empirical evidence from OECD countries, Energy Policy, 101, pp. 90-100, (2017); Angel S., Sheppard S., Civco D.L., Buckley R., Chabaeva A., Gitlin L., Kraley A., Parent J., Perlin M., The dynamics of global urban expansion, pp. 1-193, (2005); Asici A.A., On the sustainability of the economic growth path of Turkey: 1995–2009, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 52, pp. 1731-1741, (2015); Africa mining vision, pp. 1-38, (2009); (2015); Auty R.M., Natural resources, development models and sustainable development.

Yet, studies assessing the overarching effect of existing sustainability frameworks on energy production and consumption are limited. Here, we provide comprehensive assessment of energy sustainability across 217 countries and territories spanning 1960–2019. Using 11 targets and 15 indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we present winners and losers of energy sustainability by accounting for pre-millennium development goals (MDGs), MDGs, and SDGs across income groups. While the inception of the 2030 agenda has improved energy and environmental performance across economies, low-income countries are still struggling to meet several of the SDGs. We find that sustained economic growth with reduced income inequality improves energy sustainability in developing economies. However, sustainable climate policies that reduce trade-offs between energy resources and environmental threats are highly recommended in climate-prone regions that depend heavily on water resources to boost power generation capacity. © 2022 The Author(s)","Climate change; Energy sustainability; Environmental performance; Sustainable development goals","Climate Change; Economic Development; Goals; Income; Sustainable Development; Water Resources; Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy resources; Environmental management; Planning; Water resources; Climate change mitigation; Comprehensive assessment; Energy productions; Energy sustainability; Energy-consumption; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Millennium development goals; Production and consumption; Sustainable development goal; climate change; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental protection; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; article; climate change; economic aspect; economic development; energy resource; human; income group; income inequality; low income country; sustainable development goal; water availability; climate change; economic development; income; motivation; sustainable development; water supply; Sustainable development","","","","","Nord universitet","Open access funding provided by Nord University.","Blanco A.S., Gerlagh R., Suh S., Barrett J.A., de Coninck H., Diaz Morejon C.F., Mathur R., Nakicenovic N., Ahenkorah A.O., Pan J., Pathak H., Rice J., Richels R.G., Smith S.J., Stern D., Toth F.L., Zhou P., Drivers, Trends and Mitigation.

Few studies have considered the different effects of influencing factors between Northern and Southern China, and the analysis of CO2 per unit area from the spatial perspective is also rarely involved. Using the spatial Durbin model (SDM), this study aimed at revealing the influencing factors (including income, inequality, population density, urban morphology, etc.) on CO2 per capita and CO2 per unit area during 2001–2018 between Northern and Southern China. The results showed that the Northern cities had higher carbon emissions and a faster growth rate, and the high-high clusters were also mainly located in the Northern cities. The Gini coefficient was correlated adversely with CO2, while income imposed a positive effect on carbon emissions. The negative coefficients of the quadratic term of the GDP per capita demonstrated that the residential carbon emissions have the potential to decrease when the income increases to a certain level. The indirect effects of income and the Gini showed that spatial spillover effects exist. Urban population density and the ratio of residential area to built-up area had an opposite effect on CO2 per capita and CO2 per unit area, and they have a bigger impact on the CO2 per unit area. This study revealed the different roles of various factors in reducing CO2 per unit area from the spatial perspective and CO2 per capita from the non-spatial perspective between the Northern and Southern regions, which could help policymakers to design targeted mitigation measures in the residential sector in China, providing references for developing countries to jointly reduce carbon emissions to promote the mitigation of global climate change. © 2022 by the authors.","CO<sub>2</sub> per unit area; comparative analysis; income inequality; regional disparity; residential carbon emissions; spatial Durbin model","China; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Developing countries; Housing; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Carbon emissions; CO2 per unit area; Comparative analyzes; Income inequality; Northern China; Per capita; Per unit; Regional disparities; Residential carbon emission; Spatial Durbin models; carbon emission; comparative study; population density; resident population; spatial analysis; urban population; wage gap; Population statistics","","","","","Social Science of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province, (2021-CXTD-04); Henan Normal University, (2021QK24); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42001220, 42171182)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 42001220 and 42171182, the Foundation of Henan Normal University for Young Scholars, grant number 2021QK24, and the Innovation Team of Philosophy and Social Science of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province, grant number 2021-CXTD-04.","Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report; Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Core Writing Team, (2014); Lu H.L., Liu G.F., Zhang C.R., Okuda T., Approaches to quantifying carbon emissions from degradation in pan-tropic forests-implications for effective REDD monitoring, Land Degrad, 31, pp. 1-16, (2019); Hoornweg D., Sugar L., Trejos Gomez C.L., Cities and greenhouse gas emissions: Moving forward, Environ.

In addition to digitization and climate change, a possible deglobalization is also being discussed in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic and Russia’s attack on Ukraine. In particular, the disruptions and uncertainties recently observed in international value chains provide an incentive for companies to rethink and restructure supply chains. The re-nationalization of production processes contributes to greater security of supply, but sometimes at the price of higher production costs. Ultimately, these developments can affect existing market structures and competition. A decrease in the intensity of competition in the economy as a whole could have far-reaching macroeconomic consequences. Among those are, for example, declining private investment, a declining wage share, increasing income inequality, declining productivity growth and effects on inflation. © 2022, Der/die Autor:in.","","","","","","","","","Autor D., Dorn D., Katz L.F., Patterson C., Reenen J.V., The Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 135, 2, pp. 645-709, (2020); Bajgar M.G., Berlingieri C., Criscuolotimmis J., Industry Concentration in Europe and North America, OECD Productivity Working Papers, 18, (2019); Berry S., Gaynor M., Scott Morton F., Do Increasing Markups Matter?, Lessons from Empirical Industrial Organization, 33, pp. 44-68, (2019); Entwurf Eines Gesetzes Zur Verbesserung Der Wettbewerbsstrukturen Und Zur Abschöpfung Von Vorteilen Aus Wettbewerbsverstößen (Wettbewerbsdurchsetzungsgesetz), Referentenentwurf, (2022); Ressemitteilungen des Bundeskartellamts vom 28, Januar 2021 (Facebook), Vom 18.

The main goal of the study is assessment the risks of economic food security at post-COVID period. System, institutional and comparative analysis were used as methods of research. There are five types of risks in the research. We assessed monopolization in breeding, seed production and chemicalization, lockdown and value chain disruptions, increasing income inequality, food inflation, and climate changes. The introduction to the theory of nondestructive development and non-aggressive coexistence is described in the article. The authors propose a concept of non-destructive development, in which a special place is given to respect for nature, reducing aggressiveness between countries, reducing the monopolization of breeding and seed production, and reducing income inequality around the world. The monopolization of breeding and seed production is of particular concern, as it can lead to a decrease in food availability and a decrease in food security and independence. The gaps in the value chains due to the lockdown have already led to a decrease in the availability of food in individual countries. A further food crisis must not be allowed as it is fraught with social upheaval. The authors insist on the need to reduce aggression in the world, since a post-like revival of the economy is impossible in an unfavorable political situation in the world. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Abu Hatab A, Krautscheid L, Boqvist S, COVID-19, livestock systems and food security in developing countries: A systematic review of an emerging literature, Pathogens, 10, (2021); Alvi S, Roson R, Sartori M, Jamil F, An integrated assessment model for food security under climate change for South Asia, Heliyon, 7, (2021); Chen T, Gozgor G, Koo C K, Pandemics and Income Inequality: What Do the Data Tell for the Globalization Era?, Frontiers in Public Health, 9, (2021); Elias B A, Jambor A, Food security and COVID-19: A systematic review of the first-year experience, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, (2021); Flottum K, Gjerstad O, Skiple J K, Climate change and lifestyle: people's expressed motivations to adopt or not adopt a climate-friendly way of life ASp, (2021); Hossain M B, Long M A, Stretesky P B, Welfare state spending, income inequality and food insecurity in affluent nations: A cross-national examination of OECD countries, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, pp. 1-15324, (2021); Kolluru M, Semenenko T, Income Inequalities in EU Countries: Gini Indicator Analysis, Economics, 9, pp. 125-142, (2021); Kuchumov A V, Gnezdova J V, Terentyev S E, Development of the agricultural industry in the conditions of food security, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 723, (2021); Laderach P, Pacillo G, Thornton P, Osorio D, Smith D, Food systems for peace and security in a climate crisis, The Lancet Planetary Health, 5, pp. e249-e250, (2021); Niles M T, Wirkkala K B, Belarmino E H, Bertmann F, Home food procurement impacts food security and diet quality during COVID-19, BMC Public Health, 21, (2021); Osipov V, Zhevora S, Yanushkina N, Efficiency of potato production: Analysis of variation and differentiation of regions of the Russian Federation IOP Conference Series, Earth and Environmental Science, 274, (2019); Osipov V S, Skryl T V, Monitoring of potato production and its forecast by 2020, Bulgarian Journal of Agricultural Science, 25, pp. 448-453, (2019); Ramey E A, Seeds of change: Hybrid corn, monopoly, and the hunt for superprofits, Review of Radical Political Economics, 42, pp. 381-386, (2010); Santeramo F G, Exploring the link among food loss, waste and food security: what the research should focus on?, Agriculture and Food Security, 10, (2021); Skryl T, Osipov V, Vorozheikina T, On the way to ecological agriculture: Decision-making process in agrarian state policy, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 274, (2019); Wasson Charles S, System analysis, design, and development: concepts, principles, and practices, (2006)","","Rogener F.","IOP Publishing Ltd","","2021 International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Agriculture and Food Processing, TAFP 2021","10 June 2021","Virtual, Online","174985","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

These agreements reflect a concern of how to reduce carbon emissions and the pathway towards environmental improvement. Recent literature has pointed out the role of households as direct and indirect drivers of environmental impacts and as key agents in achieving low-carbon economies and climate-resilient development. Disparities in income distribution and lifestyles within and among countries, however, entail a different starting point for each country to reach sustainable pathways. The EU is fully committed to delivering on the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its implementation. Inequality continues to be a significant concern, reflected in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, we explore the relationships between household consumption patterns in the EU, income inequality, and global carbon emissions trends, using an environmentally extended multiregional and multisectoral input-output model. We study the trends in global carbon emissions associated with the different household consumption patterns and income categories over 15 years, and evaluate the role of income distribution, consumption patterns, and technological conditions by country and income group. Additionally, we study, through certain scenarios, the potential achievement of double dividends, by alleviating poverty and reducing emissions. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon footprints; Consumption patterns; Linkages; Multirregional input-output","Europe; Carbon footprint; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Global warming; Planning; Sustainable development; Carbon footprint; Consumption patterns; Global carbon emission; Household Consumption; Income distribution; Income inequality; Input-output; Linkage; Low carbon economy; Multirregional input-output; carbon footprint; energy efficiency; environmental economics; European Union; household income; income distribution; input-output analysis; international agreement; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Environmental regulations","","","","","Department of Science, University and Knowledge Society, (S40_R20); Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Spanish Government, (PID2019-106822RB-I00); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (FPU18/02038); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU","The authors acknowledge the financial support received by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Spanish Government ( PID2019-106822RB-I00 ), the Department of Science, University and Knowledge Society of the Government of Aragon (S40_R20) and the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities , grant FPU18/02038 .

On the other hand, the tourism sector is not just an active economic, societal, or environmental change agent; in turn, the tourism sector supports or is highly influenced by various factors, such as climate change, economic, political, or social factors. More recently, this industry has been highly impacted by the pandemic, technological developments and cultural trends. In this article we examined both the short and long-run relationship between tourism development and economic growth, CO2 emissions and energy consumption in European Union member states (EU27), by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for panel data. The findings suggest that economic growth and energy consumption have a statistically significant impact on the tourism index both in the short and long-run, whereas CO2 emissions only have a significant impact upon the tourism index on the long run. © 2021 The Author(s).

A better understand-ing of scorpionism determinants is essential for a precise comprehension of accident dynamics and to guide public policy. Our study is the first to model the spatio-temporal vari-ability of scorpionism across municipalities in São Paulo (SP) and to investigate its relationship with demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and climatic variables. Methodology This ecological study analyzed secondary data on scorpion envenomation in SP from 2008 to 2021, using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to perform Bayesian inference for detection of areas and periods with the most suitable conditions for scorpionism. Principal findings From the spring of 2008 to 2021, the relative risk (RR) increased eight times in SP, from 0.47 (95%CI 0.43–0.51) to 3.57 (95%CI 3.36–3.78), although there has been an apparent stabilization since 2019. The western, northern, and northwestern parts of SP showed higher risks; overall, there was a 13% decrease in scorpionism during winters. Among the covariates considered, an increase of one standard deviation in the Gini index, which cap-tures income inequality, was associated with a 11% increase in scorpion envenomation. Maximum temperatures were also associated with scorpionism, with risks doubling for temperatures above 36˚C. Relative humidity displayed a nonlinear association, with a 50% increase in risk for 30–32% humidity and reached a minimum of 0.63 RR for 75–76% humidity. Conclusions Higher temperatures, lower humidity, and social inequalities were associated with a higher risk of scorpionism in SP municipalities. By capturing local and temporal relationships across space and time, authorities can design more effective strategies that adhere to local and temporal considerations. © 2023 Chiaravalloti-Neto et al.","","Bayes Theorem; Brazil; Humans; Risk Factors; Scorpion Stings; Seasons; scorpion venom; Article; Bayes theorem; Brazil; climate change; demography; environmental factor; human; humidity; public health; relative humidity; risk factor; scorpion sting; seasonal variation; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; Bayes theorem; risk factor; scorpion sting; season","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, MRC CE&H; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/S019669/1); Wellcome Trust, WT, (217362)","F.C.N., C.L., M.P., M.B were in part supported by the Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Science 217362_Z_19_Z.

Among the existing reports on national competitiveness and rankings, such as IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook and WEF Global Competitiveness Report, there are sizable discrepancies in the ranking order for the same countries. As a result, confusion arises as such an outcome creates difficulties for government officials when translating these findings into real-world policies. The reality is that these discrepancies are due to the differences in logic and analytical models used by IMD and WEF. Therefore, in recognizing such problems and limitations, The Competitiveness of Nations 2 presents the IPS model as a new approach. Building on from Michael Porter's diamond model, it demonstrates a robust set of methodologies as well as offers several key policy implications for economies around the world that wish to enhance their competitiveness. The analytical tools used in this book can be further utilized for other units of analysis such as industries and individual firms. As this book provides a series of sophisticated methodologies and specific guidelines for enhancing national competitiveness, both academics and practitioners can derive useful implications. This annual book series was launched in 2021 and has included timely topics and in-depth discussion on national competitiveness. The first edition dealt with the COVID-19 global pandemic and the US-China trade war as its key focus. For this second edition, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issue has been selected given its growing impact on strategic decision-making at both firm and country levels for sustainable competitiveness. This edition explores the development of ESG in various regions including Asia (Japan, Korea, India), Europe (Russia), Latin America (Peru), and Africa (Sub-Saharan Africa). It addresses how firms can contribute to ESG, and what governments should do to incentivize or regulate firms' engagement in its practices. © 2023 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

This study evaluated how spatial and temporal patterns drive the assemblages of these competing species in cemeteries of New Orleans, LA, applying indicators of climatic variability, vegetation, and heat that may drive habitat selection at multiple scales. We found that Ae. aegypti was well predicted by urban heat islands (UHI) at the cemetery scale and by canopy cover directly above the cemetery vase. As predicted, UHI positively correlate to Ae. aegypti, but contrary to predictions, Ae. aegypti, was more often found under the canopy of trees in high heat cemeteries. Ae. albopictus was most often found in low heat cemeteries, but this relationship was not statistically significant, and their overall abundances in the city were lower than Ae. aegypti. Culex quinquefasciatus, another important disease vector, was also an abundant mosquito species during the sampling year, but we found that it was temporally segregated from Aedes species, showing a negative association to the climatic variables of maximum and minimum temperature, and these factors positively correlated to its more direct competitor Ae. albopictus. These findings help us understand the mechanism by which these three important vectors segregate both spatially and temporally across the city. Our study found that UHI at the cemetery scale was highly predictive of Ae. aegypti and strongly correlated to income level, with low-income cemeteries having higher UHI levels. Therefore, the effect of excessive heat, and the proliferation of the highly competent mosquito vector, Ae. aegypti, may represent an unequal disease burden for low-income neighborhoods of New Orleans that should be explored further. Our study highlights the importance of considering socioeconomic aspects as indirectly shaping spatial segregation dynamics of urban mosquito species. © 2021 by the authors.

Some advocate a more inclusive stakeholder model of capitalism. Others caution that this would be insufficient to deal with our pre-pandemic crises of income inequality and climate change. Many countries emphasize a ‘green recovery’ with improved funding for health and social protection. Progressive tax reform and fiscal policy innovations are needed, but there is concern that the world is already tilting towards a new round of austerity. Fundamentally, the capitalist growth economy rests on levels of material consumption that are unsustainable and inequitable. More radical proposals thus urge ‘degrowth’ policies to reduce consumption levels while redistributing wealth and income to allow the poorer half of humanity to achieve an ethical life expectancy. We have the policy tools to do so. We need an activist public health movement to ensure there is sufficient political will to adopt them. © 2022 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

This lack of a political response is troubling, yet people are condemned as irrational, unpatriotic, or worse–conservative–if they do not maintain optimism about a better future. There is widespread repudiation of pessimism on the left, meanwhile there is little guarantee the future will deliver a brighter tomorrow. Philosophical pessimism may seem an unexpected position from which to consider the incongruent relationships among the myth of progress, contemporary political stagnation, capitalism, and climate change. However, a critical version of this orientation offers a ballast to toxic positivity, as well as a unique orientation to the myth of progress and the domination of nature. One that enables a reframed relationship to the climate crisis, income inequality, and creeping authoritarian populism. © 2022 Caucus for a New Political Science.","","","","","","","","","","M.E.

Several studies have been conducted to address the relationship among different econometric and environmental indicators of renewable energy (RE) but overlooked the relationship between RE and income inequalities. This study investigates the influence of the distribution of income on the RE in Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa (BRICS) between 1988 and 2017. The econometric (economic growth and trade), environmental, and institutional parameters are also integrated into the model. The outcomes reveal that reduced inequality in income distribution increases the consumption of RE. In contrast, CO2 emissions have a positive correlation with RE. The governments should implement environmentally friendly policies and increase the consumption of renewable energy in the future with regards to reducing environmental pollution. Furthermore, findings from the study indicate a positive effect on the reduction of corruption in renewable energy. This shows that institutional quality can affect the uptake of renewable energy. The study further identified that growth in a country’s economy decreases RE consumption, suggesting that these countries prefer fossil fuels to gain economic growth. The Granger causality results show that a bidirectional causality exists between income inequality and RE consumption. Bidirectional causality is observed between income distribution and CO2 emissions. The results from this study are important for policymakers to achieve sustainable development because fair income distribution and environmental quality are considered as two key factors for sustainable development. Strong institutions and control on corruption can bring sound social and economic gains. Therefore, fair distribution of income and strong institutional policies can increase RE consumption to achieve a clean environment. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the implications of the planet’s new geological reality–of which climate change is the primary indicator–have not been internalised into policy and practice thus far at both the domestic and international levels. Brazil is no exception. In this article, the strategic diplomacy framework is applied to the Brazilian case as a policy proposal and diagnostic tool to (a) identify the country’s strategic climate interest, (b) propose a diplomatic strategy capable of addressing the gravity of the climate crisis, and (c) analyse the factors blocking the development of a national agenda and policy consistent with a climate security scenario. Despite Brazil’s vast natural capital, powerful interests in the agribusiness and energy sectors, lack of vision among the ruling elites, and a poorly educated population in a society still marked by high levels of poverty and income inequality have precluded the country from developing a leading role in the global climate arena. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anthropocene; Brazil; climate change; climate policy; strategic diplomacy","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (CEECIND/00065/2017)","This work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia: [Grant Number CEECIND/00065/2017].","Afionis S., Stringer L.C., Favretto N., Tomei J., Buckeridge M.S., Unpacking Brazil’s leadership in the global biofuels arena: Brazilian ethanol diplomacy in Africa, Global Environmental Politics, 16, 3, pp. 127-150, (2016); Albuquerque F.L., Coalition making and norm shaping in Brazil’s foreign policy in the climate change regime, Global Society, 33, 2, pp. 243-261, (2019); Biermann F., Abbott K., Andresen S., Backstrand K., Bernstein S., Betsill M., Bulkeley H., Cashore B., Clapp J., Folke C., Gupta A., Gupta J., Haas P.M., Jordan A., Kanie N., Kluvankova-Oravska T., Lebel L., Liverman D., Meadowcroft J., Zondervan R., Navigating the anthropocene: Improving earth system governance, Science, 335, 6074, pp. 1306-1307, (2012); Borges H., Governo Bolsonaro tenta mudar Fundo Amazônia, mas Noruega e Alemanha dizem não, O Globo, (2019); Brautzer T., Elites empresariais do Brasil apoiam Bolsonaro, Público, (2018); Campos A.C., Indígenas protestam contra licença de operação de Belo Monte, Agência Brasil, (2015); Canzian F., Frente a nova chuva de dólares e euros pelo mundo, Brasil pode acabar ficando na seca, Folha de S.

NA sustains a variety of ecosystems, terrain, climate, and cultural diversity, all potentially influenced by climate change. In a region plagued with an ever-growing carbon footprint, a focus on unyielding growth and consumption, continuously increasing income inequality, and a portion of the population which formally denies the existence of climate change altogether, research on environmental accounting is distinctive. NA EAR examines various industries and topics, with oil and gas and disclosure emerging as dominate themes. Additionally, researchers employ numerous theoretical lenses, with an inclination toward legitimacy theory. In this chapter, we outline the long history of EAR within NA, describe many unresolved issues, and discuss limitations and possible avenues for future work. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Jan Bebbington, Carlos Larrinaga, Brendan O’Dwyer, and Ian Thomson; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Aerts W., Cormier D., Media legitimacy and corporate environmental communication, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 34, 1, pp. 1-27, (2009); Al-Tuwaijri S.A., Christensen T.E., Hughes K.E., The relations among environmental disclosure, environmental performance, and economic performance: A simultaneous equations approach, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 29, 5, pp. 447-471, (2004); Alciatore M., Dee C.C., Easton P., Changes in environmental regulation and reporting: The case of the petroleum industry from 1989 to 1998, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 23, 4, pp. 295-304, (2004); Andre R., Assessing the accountability of the benefit corporation: Will this new gray sector organization enhance corporate social responsibility?, Journal of Business Ethics, 110, 1, pp. 133-150, (2012); Anderson J.C., Frankle A.W., Voluntary social reporting: An iso-beta portfolio analysis, The Accounting Review, 55, 3, (1980); Certified B Corporation, (2019); Berrone P., Fosfuri A., Gelabert L., Does greenwashing pay off?

To achieve these reductions, the climate change mitigation scenarios that dominate the literature assume large-scale deployment of negative-emissions technologies, but such technologies are unproven and present considerable trade-offs for biodiversity and food systems. In response, energy researchers have postulated low energy demand scenarios as alternatives and others have developed models for estimating the minimum energy requirements for the provision of decent material living standards considered essential for human wellbeing. However, a key question that our study aims to explore is how a climate-safe, low energy demand future, and universal decent living could be achieved simultaneously, given the magnitude of current global inequalities in energy consumption and technological access. Methods: In this modelling study, we combined data that described current global and regional inequalities in energy consumption with scenarios for low energy demand in 2050, and compared the resulting distributions with estimates of decent living energy, drawing all of this data from published academic literature. Using a threshold analysis, we estimated how much of the 2050 global population would fall below the minimum energy required to support human wellbeing if a low energy demand pathway was followed but inequalities in energy consumption remained as wide as they currently are. We then estimated the reductions in energy inequality and increases in technological equity that were required to ensure that no one falls below decent living energy in a climate-safe future. Finally, we speculated about the implications for global income inequalities. Findings: We found that unprecedented reductions in income and energy inequalities are likely to be necessary to simultaneously secure a climate-safe future and decent living standards for all. If global energy use is reduced enough to ensure climate safety, but the extent of energy inequality remains as it is today, more than 4 billion people will not have access to decent living energy. To avoid this occurrence, after remaining essentially flat for 150 years, the Gini coefficient for income inequality globally might have to fall by a factor of two (ie, to a lower extent than for some of the most egalitarian European countries) and at a rate of reduction more than double that observed in the so-called golden age of capitalism. In the Global South (South America, Central America, south Asia, southeast Asia, east Asia, the Middle East, and Africa) even greater reductions in inequality would be required, unless the average living standards in the Global North (North America, Europe, Australasia, central Asia, and Japan) and in the Global South fully converged, which would require even more substantial reductions in consumption in the Global North than low energy demand scenarios assume. Interpretation: Resolving the contradiction between the current global economic system (with its inherent inequalities) and the need for planetary and human health necessitates transformational change. Reflecting on the limitations of our analysis, we discuss four ways that these global challenges could be met without the need for such drastic reductions in inequality.

To address this issue, we develop an agent-based climate-economy model, agent-based modelling-Integrated Assessment Model, as a disaggregated, behavioural approach to integrated climate assessment. It describes networks of heterogeneous consumers, banks, power plants and firms, and is calibrated on patterns of growth and carbon dioxide emissions generated by the DICE model of Nordhaus. Whereas the latter assumes full employment and abstains from a financial sector and inequality considerations, our approach relaxes these restrictions to obtain a more reliable assessment of climate policy impacts. We show that inequalities in labour and capital income serve as essential but overlooked links between climate-change damages and optimal climate policy. Our result show that lower inequalities of labour income increase the social cost of carbon (SCC), while the impact of capital income inequalities on the SCC depends on the share of population receiving capital rents. © 2022 The Author(s).

The potential performance of the carbon tax as a supplement to the carbon ETS may contribute to achieving the carbon peaking target by reducing income inequality among the various labour forces. Nevertheless, carbon pricing places a greater burden on lower-income households than on wealthier households. In this paper, we construct a multisectoral dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and incorporate the carbon ETS and carbon tax modules with 20 labour income distributions (ID-CGE model). The results indicate that the carbon pricing mechanism has a progressive effect on income distribution and a heterogeneous effect on the income of rural and urban workers. In rural areas, the middle- and high-income labours have witnessed a higher loss in income. In contrast, in urban areas, the low-income labours have experienced a greater decrease in income. Combining carbon tax and ETS policies to achieve carbon peaking goals by 2029 is a superior strategy. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon pricing mechanism; ID-CGE model; Labour income distribution","China; Climate change; Costs; Emission control; Rural areas; Taxation; Carbon pricing; Carbon pricing mechanism; Carbon taxes; Computable general equilibrium modeling; Distribution effect; ID-computable general equilibrium model; Income distribution; Labor income distribution; Low incomes; Pricing mechanism; assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; income distribution; pollution tax; price dynamics; Carbon","","","","","","","Bi H., Xiao H., Sun K., The impact of carbon market and carbon tax on green growth pathway in China: a dynamic CGE model approach, Emerg.

Such projects will require an explicit focus on equitable benefit sharing to generate sustainable and alternative livelihoods. However, research on the impacts of forest carbon offset projects for individuals and communities has often been conducted without baseline data or counterfactuals built into the research methods. We conducted a study in a small Indigenous community in eastern Panama with participants and non-participants in a forest carbon offset project, across wealth groups. In this mixed methods study, participants and non-participants completed surveys before, during, and after implementation over 14 years to assess changes to natural and financial assets. We also assessed major concerns and perceived benefits of the carbon offset project via open-ended questions. Quantitative data show that participants continued to engage in reforestation practices even after payment cessation. Quantitative data also suggest carbon offset payments provided financial stability for poorer participants to diversify into other sources of income over time, while income inequality remained stable across wealth groups. Qualitative data indicate that the greatest benefit of the carbon offset project for participants was economic security for future generations, while concerns about basic needs like food and money declined over time for both participants and non-participants. This research suggests that forest carbon offset projects can be effective for encouraging long-term adoption of forestry practices, specifically reforestation and agroforestry, while providing social co-benefits for rural livelihoods, across wealth dimensions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon offsets; Climate change; Forest conservation; Indigenous peoples; Payment for Ecosystem Services; REDD+","Panama [Central America]; climate change; conservation management; ecosystem service; financial market; forest management; indigenous population; livelihood; sustainable development","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (223445); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada Research Chairs, (2380298); Canada Research Chairs","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery grant ( 223445 ) and Canada Research Chair, Tier 1 ( 2380298 ), to Catherine Potvin.","Adams A.M., Evans T.G., Mohammed R., Farnsworth J., Socioeconomic stratification by wealth ranking: Is it valid?, World Dev., 25, 7, pp. 1165-1172, (1997); Andersson K.P., Smith S.M., Alston L.J., Duchelle A.E., Mwangi E., Larson A.M., Wong G.Y., Wealth and the distribution of benefits from tropical forests: Implications for REDD+, Land Use Policy, 72, pp. 510-522, (2018); Bayrak M.M., Marafa L.M., Ten years of REDD+: a critical review of the impact of REDD+ on forest-dependent communities, Sustainability, 8, 7, (2016); (2005); Caplow S., Jagger P., Lawlor K., Sills E., Evaluating land use and livelihood impacts of early forest carbon projects: Lessons for learning about REDD+, Environ.

This book explores a range of political, policy, and project efforts in Seattle and the wider region to mitigate and adapt to the formidable reality of global climate change. Developing a framework suggested originally by the Urban Climate Change Research Network, the book's core analysis considers both tantalizing progress and tangible problems in Seattle's climate action initiatives so far. The narrative explores how Seattle is integrating carbon mitigation with adaptation; advancing climate action networks; co-generating risk information; coordinating disaster risk reduction with climate change adaptation; and, most importantly, focusing on historically and geographically disadvantaged populations. Linking together past, present, and future, Climate Change and the Future of Seattle argues that Seattle in the 2020s is less an 'Emerald City' than an 'Elite Emerald'. Income inequalities have grown while gentrification pressures have increased. Class structures have steadily shifted upwards, leaving the working poor and homeless especially vulnerable to climate change. Profoundly uncomfortable with this contradiction, local climate change efforts are shaped by mounting political concerns not only with mitigation-adaptation commitments and risk aversion policies to manage rising sea levels, warmer temperatures and more variable rainfall patterns, but also with reshaping a metropolitan space-economy that too often favors and consistently rewards the high-tech ""cognitariat"" over middle- and low-income households and communities of color. Ultimately, Seattle cannot become post-carbon if it is not also post-polarized, resilient if not also just. The lessons that Seattle learns in pursuit of more inclusive climate action will thus be of abiding interest to cities and metropolitan regions across the United States and all around the world. © Yonn Dierwechter 2021.

The financial resources to achieve this are increasingly available. A major challenge is the absence of scalable mechanisms that can incentivize rapid change for rural communities at the decade-long time scale needed to respond to the climate emergency. Despite moves toward inclusive green finance (IGF), a major structural gap remains between the funding available and the unbankable small-scale producers who are stewards of ecosystems. This chapter reports on inclusive finance that can help fill this gap and incentivizes improved ecosystem stewardship, productivity, and wealth creation. A key feature is the concept of eco-credit to build ecosystem management and restorative behaviors into loan terms. Eco-credit provides an approach for overcoming income inequality within communities to enhance the community-level ecosystem governance and stewardship. The paper discusses the experience of implementing the Community Environment Conservation Fund (CECF) over a 8-year-period from 2012. The CECF addresses the unbankable 80% of community members who cannot access commercial loans, has c. 20, 000 users in Uganda and pilots in Malawi, Kenya, and Tanzania. The model is contextualized alongside complementary mechanisms that can also incentivize improved ecosystem governance as well as engage and align communities, government, development partners, and the private sector. This complementary infrastructure includes commercial eco-credit as exemplified by the Climate Smart Lending Platform, and the community finance of the Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA) model upon which CECF builds. The paper describes the technologies and climate finance necessary for significant scale-up. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.","Climate change adaptation; East Africa; Ecosystems governance; Forest landscape restoration; Incentive mechanism; Inclusive finance; Land degradation neutrality; Mitigation; Nature-based solutions; Technology","","","","","","","","Inclusive green finance: A survey of the policy landscape, (2019); Andrews J.B., Caro T., Said Juma A., Collins A.C., Bidawa Bakari H., Hassan Sellieman K., Abdi M., Assaa Sharif N., Borgerhoff Mulder M., Does REDD+ have a chance?

This is particularly relevant in China because, on the one hand, China has had the largest annual carbon emissions in the world since 2006, and on the other, China's urbanization in the last 40 years has led to continuously rising economic inequality. This study uses panel data from 1995 to 2017 to show how rural-urban income inequality has impacted carbon productivity. The research findings support our position that income inequality has had significant negative effects on carbon productivity, with a coefficient of -0.113. The effects are more noticeable in the Western and Central regions. Moreover, though technology innovation and labor productivity can assist in rectifying the externalities caused by a high level of carbon productivity, they both negatively moderate the relationship between income inequality and carbon productivity with coefficients of -0.180 and -0.417, respectively. Low-carbon policies focusing on facilitating technology innovation and labor productivity without “complementary support” for narrowing income inequalities may yield unwanted outcomes. The findings also shed new light on the dynamic relationship between income inequality and carbon productivity, and provide important insights for policymakers to tackle the dual tasks of reducing inequality and mitigating climate change. © 2022","Carbon productivity; Climate change; Income inequality; Labor productivity; Technology innovation","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Productivity; Sustainable development; A-coefficient; Carbon emissions; Carbon productivities; Economic inequality; Income inequality; Labour productivities; Low-carbon policies; Panel data; Panel data analysis; Technology innovation; Climate change","","","","","","","Ali W., Abdullah A., Azam M., The dynamic relationship between structural change and CO 2 emissions in Malaysia: a cointegrating approach, Environ.

The first two have been widely studied, but less attention has been paid to the third, although it has a significant impact on the lives of millions of people in terms of healthcare, education, environmental concerns, and other socio-economic factors. Therefore, we estimated the effects of energy poverty, education, income inequalities, and globalisation on carbon emissions in BRICS countries between 1989 and 2016. We used continuously updated fully modified and continuously updated biased correction approaches, as well as the common correlated effects mean group and augmented mean group estimators to obtain model estimations that were robust against cross-country dependencies and heterogeneity. The empirical results revealed that economic growth, income inequalities, and energy poverty increased the environmental pressure on BRICS countries. However, the expansion and improvement of education had an impact, directly and indirectly, on the investigated variables and promoted globalisation. © 2022","Education; Energy poverty; Environmental complexity; Globalisation; Income; Inequalities","Climate change; Economic analysis; Energy industry; Energy poverties; Environmental complexity; Environmental concerns; Globalisation; Health care education; Income; Income inequality; Inequality; Socio-economic factor; Energy security","","","","","","","Adewale Alola A., Ozturk I., Bekun F.V., Is clean energy prosperity and technological innovation rapidly mitigating sustainable energy-development deficit in selected sub-Saharan Africa?

Attention to the identification of the direct linkage between crop switching and farm profitability, and, thus, farm sustainability, however, has been quite limited. This study at-tempts to provide a significant complement to the extant research by identifying the treatment effect of crop switching on the net returns of crop growers in Taiwan. A multinomial endogenous treatment effects model with the latent-factor structure is used to take self-selection into account. The result suggests that farm households’ economic resilience is closely related to their choice of crops, which constitute the major source of farm income. Specifically, among the six cash crop categories, fruit crops and other crops are found to be most remunerating and, thus, suggests possible improve-ments in farm households’ economic resilience through crop switching. A further analysis of the distributional implications of crop switching through quantile regression confirms the persistent and stronger effects of crop choice on net returns when moving from the bottom to the top quartiles along the net-return distribution. This result suggests a close association of crop choices with farm income inequality among the crop farm households in Taiwan, which in turn implies possible dis-tributional effects of crop switching. © 2022 by the authors.

The author reviews the basic characteristics of this model and its destinction from other market economy models. It is demonstrated that in the USA, the leading role in economic development is played by private sector, and the government occupies much more modest positions. The ideas of independence, self-reliance and individual success definitely prevail both in ideology and in economic practices. It is noted that the American model has underwent several stages in its evolution – from the 17th century until recently, and only the last 50–60 years may be regarded as a liberal period of economic devel-opment. The author demonstrates that due to the liberal model the country has reached significant economic and social results, including high economic growth and high living standards. The driving force of the American model is definitely a private sector, which generates about 90% of GDP and most investments into the economy. The liberal model is undoubtedly advantageous for the competitive part of society, for efficient workers. At the same time it is not good for a social state focused on a general welfare. However, in total, the advantages of the American model are quite obvious: commitment to high economic efficiency, development of science and innovations, economic growth and high living standards. The shortcomings of the American model are also quite evident. Among them there are: a problem of social and income inequality, the emergence of new economic challenges, including those connected with pandemics and climate change, which test the American model for its sustainability and effective-ness. Another issue is new emerging markets that are not liberal at all. Especially we can talk about China which became the real rival to the American economy. The modern stage of globalization puts several new problems before the American capitalism, such as the is exacerbation of contradictions between old industrial countries and emerging economies, between strengthened multinational corporations and the governments of the countries they came from. The author makes a conclusion that despite both internal and external challenges the existing potential of the American economic model is still not exhausted.

Yet urban inequality is often and invariably described from a limited economic perspective, commonly interpreted and measured as income inequality. This is an overtly statistical measure, or Gini‐Type index, often giving limited and unsatisfactory results. Yet, in practice, the spatial distribution and concentration of income inequality is a multi‐scalar, multi‐variant, and multi‐disciplinary issue and has links with other and wider dimensions of inequality and well‐being. As such, this article argues for a holistic understanding of urban inequality that goes beyond narrow empirical and quantitative models. It presents collaborative research that aims to impact the actions of urban professionals, to accurately identify and adequately respond to urban inequalities. Through the establishment of an interdisciplinary expert panel, we have uncovered a series of provisional mechanisms and responses to aid practitioners to achieve more spatial equality. We introduce an integrated analytical method, the “litmus test,” that acts as a planning tool for understanding, evaluating, and responding to inequalities and segregation present in the built environment. This novel methodology and procedural framework will assist us in (a) identifying and defining different forms of inequality and segregation beyond the current scope of physical and agency‐based forms; (b) measuring and demonstrating the latter with a combination of qualitative, empirical sources that are materially significant in supporting and evidencing planning strate-gies; and (c) setting out a series of planning and built environment specific responses. © 2023 by the author(s);.","inequality; levelling up; litmus test; spatial segregation; UN sustainable development goals; urban planning","","","","","","Constructing Excellence North East, Construction Industry Council; Chartered Institute of Building, CIOB; Royal Town Planning Institute, RTPI","One way to achieve this was around the exploita‐ tion of the educational resources within the framework: “It has quite good pedagogical potential…especially young planners interested in professional advocacy work‐ ing with the system” (Expert panel participant, 2022).

However, climate variability and anthropogenic climate change may seriously impact small-scale fisheries by altering the abundance and distribution of target species. Social relationships between fishery users, such as fish traders, can determine how each individual responds and is affected by changes in fisheries. These informal cooperative and competitive relationships provide access, support, and incentives for fishing and affect the distribution of benefits. Yet, individuals’ actions and impacts on individuals are often the primary focus of the economic analyses informing small-scale fisheries’ formal management. This focus dismisses relevant social relationships. We argue that this leads to a disconnect between reality and its model representation used in formal management, which may reduce formal fisheries management’s efficiency and efficacy and potentially trigger adverse consequences. Here, we examine this argument by comparing the predictions of a simple bioeconomic fishery model with those of a social-ecological model that incorporates the dynamics of cooperative relationships between fish traders. We illustrate model outcomes using an empirical case study in the Mexican Humboldt squid fishery. We find that (1) the social-ecological model with relationship dynamics substantially improves accuracy in predicting observed fishery variables to the simple bioeconomic model. (2) Income inequality outcomes are associated with changes in cooperative trade relationships. When environmental temperature is included in the model as a driver of species production dynamics, we find that climate-driven temperature variability drives a decline in catch that, in turn, reduce fishers’ income. We observe an offset of this loss in income by including cooperative relationships between fish traders (oligopoly) in the model. These relationships break down following species distribution changes and result in an increase in prices fishers receive. Finally, (3) our social-ecological model simulations show that the current fishery development program, which seeks to increase fishers’ income through an increase in domestic market demand, is supported by predictions from the simple bioeconomic model, may increase income inequality between fishers and traders. Our findings highlight the real and urgent need to re-think fisheries management models in the context of small-scale fisheries and climate change worldwide to encompass social relationship dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Environmental changes; Humboldt squid fishery; Inequality; Social structures; Social-ecological systems modeling","","","","","","Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, UNAM; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1338973); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (682472, 743080)","First and foremost, we are grateful to our interviewees and the fishery participants for their time and for sharing their knowledge about the squid fishery.

Heterogeneity across countries is related to income, emission technology, and environmental damage costs. We show that reducing global inequality would have a mitigating effect on the path of future world's carbon stock if the relative number of richly-endowed countries in the subgroup of high-tech countries is greater than that in the subgroup of low-tech countries. The response of the future world's carbon stock to a reduction in global inequality depends on the relative strength of two forces working in opposite directions: the mitigating force and the aggravating force. The mitigating force is associated with a measure of both richly-endowed/high-technology countries and poorly-endowed/low-technology countries. The aggravating force is associated with a measure of both richly-endowed/low-technology countries and poorly-endowed/high-technology countries. Status-seeking motives among countries act as a multiplier of the effects of the inequality reduction on the future path of the pollution stock. Our results highlight complex interactions to scrutinize in the design of international climate change policies while taking global inequality issues into account. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change policy; Climate finance; Emission technology; Income inequality; International redistributive policy; World's pollution stock","Carbon; Climate change; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; % reductions; Carbon stocks; Climate change policies; Climate finance; Emission technology; Global inequalities; High-technology; Income inequality; International redistributive policy; World pollution stock; carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; environmental policy; finance; income distribution; transboundary pollution; Pollution","","","","","","","Abdallah B., Belloumi M., De Wolf D., Indicators for sustainable energy development: A multivariate cointegration and causality analysis from Tunisian road transport sector, Renew.

Declines in trust are partly the result of dissatisfaction with governmental and institutional accountability and concomitant skepticism about the competency and responsiveness of institutions. Declines are also the result of a polarization in trust in institutions, as Republicans trust business, the police, religion, and the military much more than Democrats, whose confidence in these institutions, except the military, has fallen. In turn, Democrats trust labor, the press, science, higher education, and public schools much more than Republicans, whose confidence in these institutions has fallen. Declines and polarization in confidence may be traceable to political polarization stemming from increasing income inequality and segregation in America. With polarization and decreasing trust in institutions, it becomes more difficult to fight epidemics, maintain faith in policing, and deal with problems such as climate change. © 2022 by Henry E.

Climate change adaptation project might be maladapted unless it considers the local context. This paper argued challenges of agriculture in developing countries in general and Ethiopia in particular, are highly diversified, and thus any intervention requires embarrassing the specific agroecosystems. Cognizant of this fact, the research investigated locally viable climate change adaptation strategies (CCAS) specific to Rib watershed in Ethiopia by using agroecosystem analysis framework. The study used primary data collected from 383 randomly selected farm-households complemented with data collected with key-informant interviews and focus group discussions. The study area was characterized and mapped in two groups of agroecosystems: Fogera plain and Libo-Farta highlands. The finding portrayed that across agroecosystems, there were considerable differences in terms of productivity potential, inherit constraints, crop varieties, income level and soil type. The study found the blanket application of similar CCAS irrespective of the heterogeneities. Farmers in the plain land witnessed less income inequality that stood at a Gini coefficient of 38.3 as compared to the highlanders of 42.8. The study further identified prioritized CCAS for the respective agroecosystems. It is imperative to consider local diversities before any intervention efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agroecosystem characterization; Climate change adaptation; Crop production constraints; Equity; Local adaptation; Northwest Ethiopia; Rib watershed","Ethiopia; Fogera; adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; climate change; crop production; developing world; smallholder; strategic approach; watershed","","","","","Belay Simane; Aksum University, AKU; Ministry of Education, Ethiopia, MOE; Addis Ababa University, AAU","Funding text 1: This work was funded by Ethiopian Ministry of Education (Addis Ababa University and Aksum University), Ethiopia.

An ongoing debate in the field is whether or not inequality drives environmental degradation, especially carbon emissions. This study speaks to this important debate, focusing on the micro (household) level. While numerous studies address this question, they have done so largely at the macro- (cross-national) or meso- (subnational states and provinces) level. Based on probability-weighted ordinary least squares regression analysis of nationally representative data pertaining to United States households, I find substantial positive relationship between income and wealth inequality and carbon emissions from residential energy consumption. The data show huge disproportionalities in carbon emissions from energy consumption among the households analyzed, suggesting inequality does not bode well for environmental protection. What this finding also implies is that measures implemented to reduce income- and wealth-based inequalities may double as climate change mitigation policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Household data; Housing-related wealth inequality; Income inequality","United States; Carbon; Climate change; Digital storage; Housing; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; Cross-national; Energy-consumption; Household datum; Household level; Housing-related wealth inequality; Income inequality; Ordinary least-squares regression analysis; Residential sectors; Wealth inequality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; climate change; energy use; environmental degradation; environmental protection; household energy; household income; income distribution; mitigation; residential location; Energy utilization","","","","","","","Adua L., To cool a sweltering earth: does energy efficiency improvement offset the climate impacts of lifestyle?, Energy Pol., 38, 10, pp. 5719-5732, (2010); Adua L., Clark B., York R., The ineffectiveness of efficiency: the paradoxical effects of state policy on energy consumption in the United States, Energy Res.

The book explores the questions of what member nations of the United Nations, working with international organizations, have been able to achieve thus far in food and agriculture and in economic transformation; how they have responded to the rapidly changing external environment and factors internal to the organizations; and how well equipped they are to address future challenges of poverty, food security and nutrition, inequality, climate change, degradation of natural resources, and conflict, in the face of rapidly deteriorating natural resources and advancing science. Discovering the answers to these questions makes this discussion all the more urgent. Most importantly, we explore the roles of the traditional international organizations established in the post-Second World War period vis-à-vis new actors, philanthropists, and the private sector in contributing to growth and development. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the structural weaknesses among the mightiest economies of income inequalities, lack of universal access to health, and lack of trust in government. Smaller Asian Tigers-Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea-in addition to China, where the pandemic originated-had smarter responses, demonstrating their superior state capacity.

Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes panel data from the period 2000–2018 on 53 African countries and system generalized method of moments (system GMM) for the analysis. Findings: The result indicates that flood occurrence causes the destruction of health facilities and the spread of diseases which reduces life expectancy. In addition, flood occurrence increases mortality rate amongst 53 African countries. implications: Practical implications: The study recommends that governments amongst African countries should implement strategies being enshrined in Conference of Parties (COP, 2021) on climate change. This will help to reduce the level of climate change and flood occurrence. Originality/value: Previous studies focussed on the adverse effect of flood occurrence without considering the issue of life expectancy amongst African countries. This study contributes to existing empirical studies by examining the effect of flood occurrence on mortality rate and life expectancy amongst African countries.

The World Health Organization Housing and health guidelines highlight interventions that protect occupants from cold and hot temperatures, injuries, and other hazards. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of ventilation standards. Housing standards are unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally, despite robust research demonstrating that retrofitting existing houses and constructing high-quality new ones can reduce respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and people with low incomes face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by poor-quality housing. These can be partially ameliorated by community-based programs to improve housing quality, particularly for children and older people, who are hospitalized more often for housing-related illnesses. There is renewed interest among policy makers and researchers in the health and well-being of people in public and subsidized housing, who are disproportionately disadvantaged by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries. Improving the overall quality of new and existing housing and neighborhoods has multiple cobenefits, including reducing carbon emissions. © 2023 Annual Reviews Inc..

However, tensions between lifelong residents, more recent transplants, visitors, and developers have increased as more of the world discovers this once-isolated haven. Climate change, income inequality, and alienation from a distant government apparatus have further complicated effective land-use planning and fractured social cohesion. Using a mixed-method approach of in-depth interviews (n = 67), Q methodology (n = 79), and public deliberation (n = 88), we explored residents’ priorities for the future of their town. The results indicate four different perspectives on Nosara’s future. Despite the tensions among those four perspectives, they show consensus on one overarching community issue: the need for a sustainable development plan. The case also shows how Q-methodology can assist scholars and practitioners who embrace participatory approaches to policy development and conflict resolution in the environmental arena. © 2022 by the authors.","Costa Rica; public engagement; Q methodology; sustainable development","Costa Rica; climate change; land use planning; policy development; public goods; sustainable development","","","","","Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University","This research was funded by the Demo Lab (a Costa Rican nonprofit; no grant number available).

The inclusion of this agenda in the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations has shown that worsened environmental degradation is currently a major threat facing humankind. The World Commission on Environment and Development 2015 has highlighted that income inequality is one of the major causes for environmental deterioration. Hence, reducing environmental degradation requires a look at the problem of unequal income distribution. Moreover, educational attainment plays a vital role in providing relevant knowledge and skills to people in handling environmental problems. Thus, the objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between income inequality, educational attainment, and CO2 emissions by employing a panel data analysis for a group of 64 countries from 1990 to 2016.The study uses mainly dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE) estimator to take into account the issue of cross-section dependence which has been ignored by most of the previous studies. By tackling the problem of cross-section dependence, unbiased and reliable results could be produced in estimations. Our results portray that an inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is found to be valid. Additionally, income inequality has a negative impact on environmental degradation. Likewise, educational attainment and CO2 emissions are revealed to be negatively correlated. The findings of the study could provide a better understanding on the root causes of environmental degradation, and further suggest remedial actions to overcome the problem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE) estimator; Educational attainment; Environmental degradation; Income inequality","Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Educational Status; Humans; Income; Sustainable Development; carbon dioxide; climate change; correlation; educational attainment; environmental degradation; global perspective; income; panel data; Sustainable Development Goal; economic development; educational status; human; income; sustainable development","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, ","","","","","Ahmad M., Muslija A., Satrovic E., Does economic prosperity lead to environmental sustainability in developing economies?

Research has suggested that status anxiety may be the mechanism that connects income inequality with status consumption, but the literature is disparate. In this interdisciplinary review, we draw together the evidence and explore the implications for climate change and sustainability, identifying that status anxiety may be a key driver of the higher levels of consumption in more unequal contexts. We find that status-anxiety fuelled consumption is associated with household debt, spatial inequalities, cycles of unsustainable consumption and longer commuting times, ultimately contributing to higher carbon emissions. We propose that further research should include more in-depth study and cohesive measurement of status anxiety and seek to better understand how to reduce unsustainable patterns of status-anxiety driven consumption.

The special issue turned into a triple issue receiving a large number of submissions from across the world. A synthesis of the articles suggests several threads. First, lesbian identity remains important to many women across the world. Whereas some academic writing and communities in the United States have shifted toward queerness, this move is resisted among many lesbians, especially in communities outside of the U.S. Women who sustain lesbian identity must confront attacks that morph and change across time and space. Some lesbians are marginalized because they are seen as psychologically deviant, whereas others are framed as criminals; a more recent form of marginalization equates lesbianism with transphobia. To face these attacks, lesbian intellectual traditions offer an understanding of lesbian identity as political, nonessentialist, intersectional, and community grounded. The rejection of the “born this way narrative” of lesbian identity allows lesbianism to be inclusive of different configurations of gender identities including trans, nonbinary, and cis women as well as sexual orientations including bisexuality, demisexuality, and asexuality. An understanding of lesbianism as grounded in politics of inclusion and solidarity sustains the power of the lesbian movement to fight the rise of neo-fascism and the devastation of climate change. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","intersectionality; Lesbian; lesbian erasure; lesbianphobia; queer","Bisexuality; Female; Feminism; Gender Identity; Homosexuality, Female; Humans; Sexual and Gender Minorities; United States; bisexuality; female; feminism; gender identity; human; lesbianism; sexual and gender minority; United States","","","","","","","Fahs B., Queer nation manifesto: Queer read this, Burn it down!

Hence, this study was initiated to assess the socioeconomic contribution of dry forests to climate change adaptation in Tigray Region, Ethiopia. A mixed quantitative and qualitative research design was used to examine the role of dry forests in climate change adaptation. Household questionnaire survey, key informants, and a focus group discussion were used to collect data. The results indicated that 94% of all households visited a dry forest at least once a month to access the forest and forest products. While the dry forest income level varied significantly (p < 0.05), the overall dry forest income level contributed to 16.8% of the total household income. Dry forest income enabled the reduction of the area between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve by 21% in dry evergreen Afromontane Forest users, by 3.02% in Combretum–Terminalia woodland users, and by 3% in Acacia–Commiphora woodland users. Gender, occupation, wealth status, and distance from the forest to their homes are all factors that significantly affected Combretum–Terminalia woodland users’ income level. Among Acacia–Commiphora woodland users, the respondents’ age influenced the dry forest income level, whereas, among dry evergreen Afromontane Forest users, the family size of the household influenced the dry forest income level. The findings of this study could help policy makers understand the crucial role of dry forest income in the livelihood of the community and in climate change adaptation. Policymakers could reduce the pressure on dry forests by introducing policies that recognize the role of dry forest income in reducing poverty and income inequality and by establishing farmer cooperation in commercializing the non-timber forest products which support the long-term coping and adaptation strategy. Further research is needed to understand the increasing role of dry forest products in climate change adaptation over time and its contribution to the national economy at large. © 2022 by the authors.","adaptation; climate change; dry forest income; livelihood","Adaptation; Economics; Ethiopia; Forest Products; Forestry; Forests; Pressure; Research; Ethiopia; Tigray; Economics; Forestry; 'Dry' [; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Dry forest income; Dry forests; Ethiopia; Evergreen afromontane forests; Forest products; Income levels; Livelihood; agricultural cooperative; climate change; commercialization; dry forest; forest product; household income; livelihood; national economy; poverty alleviation; woodland; Climate change","","","","","Leibniz-Gemeinschaft, LG; Ethiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute, EEFRI","This research was funded by the then Ethiopian Environment and Forestry Research Institute, now merged with Ethiopian Forestry Development.

However, little is known about area-level characteristics that confer vulnerability to temperature-related mortality. Objectives: Explore city-level socioeconomic and demographic characteristics associated with temperature-related mortality in Latin American cities. Methods: The dependent variables quantify city-specific associations between temperature and mortality: heat- and cold-related excess death fractions (EDF, or percentages of total deaths attributed to cold/hot temperatures), and the relative mortality risk (RR) associated with 1 °C difference in temperature in 325 cities during 2002–2015. Random effects meta-regressions were used to investigate whether EDFs and RRs associated with heat and cold varied by city-level characteristics, including population size, population density, built-up area, age-standardized mortality rate, poverty, living conditions, educational attainment, income inequality, and residential segregation by education level. Results: We find limited effect modification of cold-related mortality by city-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and several unexpected associations for heat-related mortality. For example, cities in the highest compared to the lowest tertile of income inequality have all-age cold-related excess mortality that is, on average, 3.45 percentage points higher (95% CI: 0.33, 6.56). Higher poverty and higher segregation were also associated with higher cold EDF among those 65 and older. Large, densely populated cities, and cities with high levels of poverty and income inequality experience smaller heat EDFs compared to smaller and less densely populated cities, and cities with little poverty and income inequality. Discussion: Evidence of effect modification of cold-related mortality in Latin American cities was limited, and unexpected patterns of modification of heat-related mortality were observed. Socioeconomic deprivation may impact cold-related mortality, particularly among the elderly. The findings of higher levels of poverty and income inequality associated with lower heat-related mortality deserve further investigation given the increasing importance of urban adaptation to climate change. © 2022 The Authors","Climate change; Latin America; Temperature-related mortality; Urban health","Aged; Cities; Cold Temperature; Demography; Humans; Latin America; Mortality; Socioeconomic Factors; Temperature; Latin America; climate change; demography; income distribution; mortality; poverty; socioeconomic conditions; temperature effect; urban population; urbanization; aged; article; city; climate change; cold stress; controlled study; demographics; dependent variable; education; educational status; excess mortality; heat; high temperature; human; income inequality; mental capacity; mortality; mortality rate; mortality risk; population density; population size; poverty; quantitative analysis; social segregation; South and Central America; urban area; urban health; city; cold; demography; epidemiology; socioeconomics; South and Central America; temperature","","","","","Wellcome Trust, WT, (216029, 205177/Z/16/Z, 216029/Z/19/Z)","This study was financially supported by the Wellcome Trust [216029/Z/19/Z], [205177/Z/16/Z].

We do so by means of a simultaneous equations approach on a panel of 149 countries from 1992 to 2018. The empirical analysis reveals that countries with higher levels of income inequality suffer greater damages when hit by a natural disaster. At the same time, inequality is found to increase the number of people affected by disasters. Our analysis discloses the existence of a vicious cycle that keeps some countries stuck in a disasters-inequality trap. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Inequality; Natural disasters; System of simultaneous equations","climate change; income; natural disaster; vulnerability","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España, MINECO, (ECO2017-86976-R); Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España, MINECO","FC and VC acknowledge the financial support of the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR), Scientific Research Program of National Relevance PRIN2017 project “Innovation for global challenges in a connected world: the role of local resources and socio-economic conditions”.

I learned that the relevance of city diplomacy depends on the role cities can play in tackling global challenges as climate change, income inequality, migration and pandemics like COVID-19. Cities are where international agendas get implemented and where urban challenges and solutions are more evident, their proximity with citizens validates the policy making process; partnership building is more effective, and a certain administrative flexibility allows them to act faster than national governments. This chapter provides several examples from my experience on the ground to show the complexities of the relation between international law, governance and local implementation. In cities from developing countries, maintaining an active international city diplomacy role is not easy. Along the chapter I will portray how I dealt with several city diplomacy difficulties and disappointments; as well as the achievements that Quito gained through international engagement initiatives during my mayoral term. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2021.","","","","","","","","","Czarniawska B., A Tale of Three Cities: Or the Glocalization of City Management, (2002); Roudometof V., Theorizing Glocalization: Three Interpretations, European Journal of Social Theory, 19, (2016); Drori G.S., Hollerer M.A., Walgenbach P., Global Themes and Local Variations in Organization and Management: Perspectives on Glocalization, (2013); Robertson R., Glocalization, Encyclopedia of Globalization, (2006); Acuto M., Give Cities a Seat at the Top Table, Nature International Weekly Journal of Science, 537, 7622, pp. 611-613, (2016); Curtis S., Acuto M., The Foreign Policy of Cities, RUSI Journal, 163, 8, (2018); Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments; CITYFOOD Network; Acuto M., Et al., City Diplomacy: Towards More Strategic Networking?

The Covid-19 could have major long term impacts on GDP, household income, inequality, CO2 emissions, and carbon prices. Significant slowdown in labour intensive informal sectors such as construction and services, as well as in energy intensive and capital goods sectors, leads to adverse impacts on household income and inequality. Our analysis further suggests that climate policy consistent with the Paris Agreement target can complement the economic recovery process. Specifically, recycling of carbon tax revenues to investments could stimulate growth and employment, reduce inequality, and reduce carbon emissions, compared to a scenario without climate policy. Therefore, the need of the hour is to formulate and implement climate friendly recovery strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pricing; CGE model; COVID-19; Impact assessment; India; Paris agreement","India; Carbon; Climate models; Costs; Economic analysis; Investments; Recovery; Analysis of alternatives; Carbon pricing; CGE model; Climate policy; COVID-19; Economic recovery; Household income; Impact assessments; India; Paris agreement; carbon emission; computer simulation; COVID-19; emission inventory; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; household income; numerical model; targeting; Climate change","","","","","Institut für Weltwirtschaft, IfW","This work is supported by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy to attend one Workshop in Spain .

There are various factors that cause income inequality, and meanwhile additional factors are occurring. Climate change is one of the emerging factors that has a nonignorable impact on income inequality between countries and also within countries. Climate change makes income inequality deeper for the more vulnerable countries. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between climate change and income inequality. It examines the relationship for Turkey. It uses the Gini coefficient as the indicator of income inequality, and CO2 emissions represents the climate change. It utilizes descriptive analysis to illustrate the relation. It is emphasized that the climate change effects will increase the income inequality in Turkey. If the policymakers do not adopt policies related to combating climate change, the income inequality gets higher depending on this factor. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2021.","Climate change; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Economic discrimination; Income inequality","","","","","","","","Acker J., Williams R., Chiu L., Ardanuy P., Miller S., Schueler C., Vachon P.W., Manore M., Remote Sensing from Satellites, Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences, Elsevier, (2014); Climate Change & the Financial Sector: An Agenda for Action, (2005); Arouri M.E.H., Ben Youssef A., M'henni H., Rault C., Energy consumption, economic growth and CO 2 emissions in Middle East and North African countries, Energy Policy, 45, pp. 342-349, (2012); Baarsch F., Granadillos J.R., Hare W., Knaus M., Krapp M., Schaeffer M., Lotze-Campen H., The impact of climate change on incomes and convergence in Africa, World Development, 126, (2020); Babacan H., Women and Economic Dimensions of Climate Change, In Economic Effects of Natural Disasters, (2021); Becker G.S., The Economics of Discrimination.

The effects of climate change on economic output and financial stability have received considerable attention, but there has been much less focus on the relationship between climate change and income inequality. In this paper, we provide new evidence on the association between climate change and income inequality, using a large panel of 158 countries during the period 1995–2019. We find that an increase in climate change vulnerability is positively associated with rising income inequality. More interestingly, splitting the sample into country groups reveals a considerable contrast in the impact of climate change on income inequality. While climate change vulnerability has no statistically significant effect on income distribution in advanced economies, the coefficient on climate change vulnerability is seven times greater and statistically highly significant in the case of developing countries due largely to weaker capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation. These findings are robust with alternative estimation methods and measures of income inequality, but it should be noted that the appropriate measurement of climate change vulnerability and resilience remains a challenge that imposes limits on empirical analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Income inequality; Resilience; Vulnerability","Developing countries; Advanced economies; Climate change mitigation; Economic output; Financial stability; Income distribution; Income inequality; Output stability; Resilience; Splittings; Vulnerability; adaptive management; climate change; developing world; empirical analysis; estimation method; income distribution; vulnerability; Climate change","","","","","International Myeloma Foundation, IMF; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UID/ECO/00436/2019, UID/SOC/04521/2019); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","Funding text 1: We thank two anonymous referees for useful comments and suggestions.

To address this research gap, we present some numerical simulations based on a recursive-dynamic general equilibrium model with household details, focusing on relative and absolute poverty in six developing countries: Albania, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nicaragua, and Vietnam. The results under the SSP2 reference scenario suggest that the exogenously projected gross domestic product (GDP) and population growth, combined with long-term structural change, produce lower absolute but higher relative poverty. An alternative scenario of stronger trade integration further amplifies the impact on income inequality. Indeed, more international trade tends to increase capital income, which mainly benefits rich households, but generally decreases agricultural earnings, which are important for rural poor households. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Economic growth; Income distribution; Poverty; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Trade","","","","","","FAO, (RA30402000000); Food and Agricultural Organization; Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the united nations (“FAO”) (FAO Budget Code: GF.ESTDD:RA30402000000 ). ; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers, associate editor and the editors of the journal for their insightful comments that greatly improved this paper.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate sustainable migration and development in an integrative manner, including economic, social and environmental perspectives linking theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of migration and sustainable development was developed in a structured and integrative manner, and the shift in migration and development patterns in Thailand was examined from an empirical and theoretical standpoint. Findings: Migration contributes to Thailand’s economy in many ways. Migrant workers help to grow the economy, especially in labor-intensive sectors. This helps reduced income inequalities at the household level through remittances. Climate change will enhance migration, especially from neighboring countries and within Thailand itself, thus helping to reduce poverty and income inequality. Possible economic gains from migration, as well as circulating workers and international retirement migrants are highlighted. Research limitations/implications: Only studies published in English or Thai were included, which may have resulted in the omission of some research. A need for rethinking policy design and implementation as a source of sustainable development is required. Originality/value: Despite the recent influences of political and environmental changes, there has previously been no analysis of migration and sustainable development in Thailand in a structured and integrative manner as in this study. The impact of migration on the diffusion of new technology and brain drain issues was also addressed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Migration and development; Migration policy; Sustainable development;

This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R0 from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors-population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality-as having strong relationships with R0, across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R0 but were positive. Conclusion Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

Megacities are large urban agglomerations with more than 10 million inhabitants that emerged in the 20th century. The world’s top 100 economies include many North and South Amer-ican megacities, such as New York, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires; European cities such as London and Paris; and Asian cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Beijing and Mumbai. This paper addresses a dearth of megacity energy metabolism models in the literature. Cross-sectional data for 36 global megacities were collected from many literature and Internet sources. Variables included megacity name, country and region; population; area; population den-sity; (per capita) GDP; income inequality measures; (per capita) energy consumption; household electricity prices; (per capita) carbon and ecological footprint; degree days; average urban heat island intensity; and temperature and precipitation. A descriptive comparison of the characteristics of megacities was followed by ordinary least squares with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors that were used to estimate four alternative multiple regression models. The per-capita carbon footprint of megacities was positively associated with the megacity GDP per capita, and the megacity ecological footprint; and negatively associated with country income inequality, a low-income country dummy, the country household electricity price, and the megacity annual precipitation. Tar-geted policies are needed, but more policy autonomy should be left to megacities. Collecting longi-tudinal data for megacities is very challenging but should be a next step to overcome misspecifica-tion and bias issues that plague cross-sectional approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

To this end, this study investigates the impact of climate change on achieving pro-poor economic growth in Africa. Predicated on poverty-inequality-climate analysis, the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator is used to analyse data from 1996 to 2020 covering 51 African countries. The results reveal that climate change significantly impedes inclusive growth. Furthermore, evidence of a long-lasting negative effect of climate change on inclusive growth, which could be attributed to a lack of coping mechanisms among the poor and vulnerable groups, is found. Finally, the findings show a marginal impact of institutional quality and government spending on inclusive growth in the face of climate change. The study recommends more climate mitigation efforts and enhanced adaptation mechanisms, especially for the poor, as they are most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. © 2023 The Author(s).

To achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to resolve these issues. Purpose of the article: To shed light on the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions based on Russian regional data covering the years 2004–2018. Methods: Gini index and decile dispersion ratio are used to measure income inequality. To study the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions in the Russian regions, we estimate econometric models with fixed and random effects and apply GMM method. We test the hypothesis of the environmental Kuznets curve to determine the impact of economic growth on CO2 emissions. Findings & value added: The results show that CO2 emissions increase in tandem with growth in income inequality between 10% of people with the lowest income and 10% of people with the highest income. Simultaneously, CO2 emissions decrease with growth of Gini coefficient. The hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve was confirmed based on GMM method. Our findings underscore that the activities of the extraction and manufacturing sectors, as well as energy consumption, increase CO2 emissions. The chief significance of this paper is the finding that large income gap between extremely rich and extremely poor population cohorts increases CO2 emissions. This implies that economic policy aimed at reducing income inequality in Russian regions will also reduce CO2 emissions, especially if accompanied by increased use of environmentally friendly technologies. From the international perspective, our research can be extended to study other countries and regions. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych.","Climate change; CO2 emissions; Economic development; Environmental Kuznets curve; Income inequality","","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (19-18-00262); Russian Science Foundation, RSF","This research was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation № 19-18-00262: “Empirical modelling of balanced technological and socioeconomic development in the Russian regions”.","Al Mamun M., Sohag K., Hannan Mia M.

However, there has been a lack of attention to the impacts of such policies on the elderly, especially the low-income elderly, in existing climate policy literature. Here, we quantify and compare the distributional impacts of carbon pricing on different age-income groups in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan and then on different age groups in other 28 developed countries. We find that the elderly are more vulnerable to carbon pricing than younger groups in the same income group. In particular, the low-income elderly and elderly in less wealthy countries face greater challenges because carbon pricing lead to both higher rate of increase in living cost among low-income elderly and greater income inequality within the same age group. In addition, the low-income elderly would benefit less than the younger groups within the same income group in the commonly proposed carbon revenues recycling schemes. The high vulnerability of the low-income elderly to carbon pricing calls for targeted social protection along with climate mitigation polices toward an aging world. © The Author(s) 2023.

Hence, this study examined the existence of a feedback relationship between climate change and income inequality in Nigeria. The study employed an annual data series for the period from 1980 to 2020 which was estimated with the Dynamic Ordinary Least Square. Income inequality was measured by Gini while climate change was captured by temperature. The upshot of the study revealed that there is a feedback substantial connectivity between climate change and income inequality. The impact of climate change on income inequality conformed to the U-shaped hypothesis. Other factors of climate change were population growth, economic development, and emission of carbon dioxide. Hence, the study pertinently advocates and recommends effective population control, reduction of income inequality through the provision of employment and education, and the supply of modern and efficient energy in the purse of economic growth and development. © 2022, Econjournals.

Not only has business contributed to these problems but it also plays an important role in addressing them. Problems are “wicked” because they are embedded in complex systems that are continuously evolving. As no single actor can understand and solve a wicked problem, prior research has suggested that multiple actors, such as researchers and managers, come together to cocreate solutions. The cocreation process typically relies on the existing knowledge of the actors involved in the process. Yet, the dynamic nature of wicked problems requires actors to not just rely on cocreating on past knowledge but to cocreate tools that address future emerging or evolving problems. In this paper we seek to explain how researchers and managers can cocreate forward to address wicked problems. We illustrate the concept of cocreating forward through an innovation lab located at a Canadian business school. The lab brings together researchers, managers, and practitioners from various sectors to cocreate corporate innovation processes for addressing wicked problems. By cocreating forward, we show that research, learning, and practice need not be sequential but rather simultaneous activities.

In a larger sense, it is a reflection on how the United States has grown and matured, faced challenges and opportunities, and how its federal leaders and policymakers have responded or failed to confront pressing problems. Moreover, American Public Policy addresses the hurdles and challenges that still lie ahead. Four critical questions are posed and answered. First, what were the most significant adversities endured by the American people? Second, what were the landmark domestic policies crafted by the president, enacted by Congress, or issued in Supreme Court decisions? Third, what did they fail to do? Finally, how well have federal policymakers met the key challenges facing America: income inequality, racism, financial crises, terrorist attacks, climate change, gun violence, and other pressures? And what do we still need to do? This book reaches out to students of public policy, American government, US history, and contemporary affairs, as well as to citizens, journalists, and policy practitioners. © 2023 Dennis W.

Here we analyze socioeconomic dimensions of adaptive capacity of populations to deal with heat stress and find income, urbanization and income inequality to be important factors in explaining adaptation to heat stress with air conditioning (AC). Using the scenario framework of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), we estimate the future cooling gap, which represents the difference between the population exposed to heat stress and the population able to protect against heat stress with AC. Depending on the scenario of socioeconomic development, total population affected by the cooling gap may vary between 2 billion and 5 billion people in 2050, with the scenario-dependent range widening further towards the end of the century. Our analysis shows vast regional inequalities in adaptive capacity for one of the most universal manifestations of climate change, underscoring the need to account for the different potential levels of adaptive capacity in assessments of climate change impacts. © 2021 The Author(s).

Carbon pricing is an effective measure for reducing carbon emissions, but its distributional effects may exacerbate inequity among different rural and urban households. As a leading carbon pricing pilot area in China, Guangdong Province is the subject area of this paper. By using the environmentally extended input-output model and calculating the Suits index, this study aims to compare the carbon price payments of ten income-level households in Guangdong Province in 2012 and 2017. The results indicate that higher-income households need to pay more for carbon emissions. Total carbon pricing in Guangdong is slightly progressive, and the progressivity increased from 2012 to 2017. Thus, the implementation of carbon pricing may not intensify the inequality between urban and rural areas and between different income groups. Only carbon pricing on residential energy consumption is regressive, which could be compensated by revenue recycling policies. The findings of this study contribute by offering a positive theoretical basis for China's future policies on carbon pricing such as carbon taxes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon pricing; Guangdong province; Input-output analysis","Climate change; Costs; Economics; Energy utilization; Rural areas; Carbon emissions; Carbon pricing; Case-studies; Chinese Government; Climate change mitigation; Government IS; Guangdong Province; Income inequality; Input/Output analysis; Mitigation policies; Carbon","","","","","","","Agostini C.A., Jimenez J., The distributional incidence of the gasoline tax in Chile, Energy Pol., 85, pp. 243-252, (2015); Baranzini A., Goldemberg J., Speck S., A future for carbon taxes, Ecol.

They include quantified projections of socioeconomic variables such as population, income levels, inequalities, and emissions over the twenty-first century. The SSP’s population projections embody explicit, pathway-specific international migration assumptions, which are only implicit in the projections of other variables. In this contribution, we explicitly quantify the effects of international migration on income levels and income inequality across and within countries by comparing the original SSP projections to scenarios of zero migration. Income projections without migration are obtained by removing two effects of migration on income dynamics: changes in population size and remittances sent to origin countries. We base our remittance estimates on migrant stocks derived from bilateral migration flow estimates obtained from a gravity model. We find that, on average, migration tends to make the world richer in all SSP narratives. The nature of migration and remittance corridors is shaped by the specific scenario of future development considered. Depending on the particular SSP narrative and world region considered, the effects of migration on income can be substantial, ranging from −5 to +21% at the continental level. We show that migration tends to decrease income inequality across countries and within country in most destination countries but does not affect within-country inequality in origin countries. This new set of projections is consistent with the interdisciplinary framework of the SSPs, which makes it particularly useful for assessing global climate and sustainable development policy options. © 2021, The Author(s).","Income; Inequality; International migration; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Matthiola; Population statistics; Regional planning; Development policies; Global climates; Gravity model; Income inequality; Income levels; Interdisciplinary frameworks; Migration flows; Population sizes; climate change; global climate; interdisciplinary approach; international migration; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development; Climate change","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; National Academy of Sciences, NAS; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, IIASA","Open access funding provided by International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).

They participate in the powerful archetypes of death and inequality. ‘Increase’, Hexagram 42 in the I Ching, archetypically addresses inequalities at all levels – racial, economic, political and the profound imbalance between humans and the environment. Floyd’s death highlights the consequences of systemic racism and income inequalities. The pandemic as ‘nature’s revenge’ hits minority populations harder due to underlying health conditions resulting from poverty and greater exposure to the virus in the workplace. President Trump as Trickster showed Americans their shadow and his response to the pandemic amplified its severity. The pandemic has shocked our social, political and economic systems and paused our species rush into environmental disasters at many levels. The disruptions present opportunities for reflection, experimentation and developing new systems as old forms are challenged. The ecological dimensions of Jung’s concepts emphasize interconnectedness at all levels and the paradigm shift he called a ‘new age’ provides a framework for altering the course of the Anthropocene Era. © 2021, The Society of Analytical Psychology","analytical psychology; archetypal; COVID-19; culture; Jung; shadow","COVID-19; Homicide; Humans; Police; Psychoanalytic Theory; Racism; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; homicide; human; police; psychoanalytic theory; racism; socioeconomics; United States","","","","","","","Violent clearing of Lafayette Square and a frustrated president’s controversial photo-op – how one of Trump’s most consequential days in the White House came about, (2020); Chicago dashcam video shows police killing of Laquan McDonald – video, (2015); Cobb J., Race, Police and the Pandemic.

These two problems are usually tackled separately in the policy agenda. A new breed of radical proposals have been advanced to manage a fair low-carbon transition. In this spirit, we develop a dynamic macrosimulation model to investigate the long-term effects of three scenarios: green growth, policies for social equity, and degrowth. The green growth scenario, based on technological progress and environmental policies, achieves a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of increasing income inequality and unemployment. The policies for social equity scenario adds direct labour market interventions that result in an environmental performance similar to green growth while improving social conditions at the cost of increasing public deficit. The degrowth scenario further adds a reduction in consumption and exports, and achieves a greater reduction in emissions and inequality with higher public deficit, despite the introduction of a wealth tax. We argue that new radical social policies can combine social prosperity and low-carbon emissions and are economically and politically feasible. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Carbon; Climate change; Employment; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Taxation; Environmental performance; Environmental policy; Feasible alternatives; Long-term effects; Low-carbon emissions; Low-carbon transitions; Social conditions; Technological progress; Gas emissions","","","","","Horizon 2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (821105); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","This research was commissioned by B.

There are many warning signs that this traditional model is no longer working, including growing income inequality, increasing risks and costs of climate change, and an emerging backlash against technology and globalization-all of which are now beginning to threaten the viability of the current model of corporate capitalism. While there have been many efforts to adopt more enlightened approaches and mitigate such externalities, limited overall progress has been made on key issues like plastics pollution, CO2 emissions, and income inequality. Such issues are challenging because of delays between action and impact, a disjunction between private costs and collective benefits, intergenerational and intragenerational distribution issues, and the scale of coordination required to mitigate. Several perspectives from systems science and biology can help shape a new paradigm, including recent thinking on: nested complex adaptive systems, system robustness and longevity, system leverage points, and the effectiveness of bottom-up solutions. Leveraging these, we propose some principles for a new paradigm for corporate strategy, including: setting enterprise strategy in a broader system context, a greater emphasis on resilience, building corporate statesmanship, and developing a new approach to sustainable business model innovation. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Herman Bril, Georg Kell and Andreas Rasche.","","","","","","","","","S-Ray.

The increase in urbanization, the movement of people from rural communities relocating into urban areas, the issue of population density, and a rise in extreme weather are all contributing to these challenges. Although natural and manmade disasters have always existed, the increase in urbanization as a result of the movement of people into urban areas, the resulting increase in population density, and a rise in frequency of extreme weather events are factors that contribute to these challenges. There is a growing field of evidence that individuals experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted by disasters due to factors such as exposure to the elements, lack of resources and services, as well as disenfranchisement, and stigma associated with homelessness, all while experiencing greater occurrences of environmental injustice. The shrinking support for funding such services, increasing income inequality between classes, and cultural justifications for criminalizing poverty and homelessness contribute to our collective understanding of disaster vulnerability when experiencing homelessness. Given that there are distinct needs for individuals experiencing homelessness when affected by disasters, this article proposes recommendations for improving policy, research, and services to address these disparities. Trends in income inequality and homelessness have serious implications for planning and response, and recovery from natural or manmade disasters. As such, there is a need to periodically review progress, identify current gaps and unmet needs, and identify opportunities for improvement. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","advocacy; climate change;

However, the impact of inequality on consumption-based emissions has been scarcely analysed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to test the relationship between income inequality and consumption-based GHG emission per capita by applying the country-level data for 1990–2014. Due to the prevailing economic structures, those relationships may be non-linear and imposition of pre-defined functional relationships in the estimation may induce additional bias. In order to circumvent this issue, the partially linear regression is applied in this paper. The non-parametric part of the regression is applied to examine the linkages between the income inequality and GHG emission per capita, whereas the other controlling variables are included in the linear part of the model. The results indicate a non-liner relationship between income inequality and GHG emission per capita along with a U-shape relationship between GDP per capita and the GHG emission per capita. This suggests tailored environmental policies are required for regions with diverse economic structures. This paper reveals how to achieve the reduction of income inequality and climate change simultaneously. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Ecological footprint; Income inequality; Partially linear model","Environmental Policy; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Income; Linear Models; Socioeconomic Factors; Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; Carbon emissions; Consumption levels; Ecological footprint; Economic structure; Greenhouse gas emissions; Income inequality; Linear approach; Non linear; Partially linear models; Per capita; climate change; emission inventory; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; income distribution; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; economic development; education; environmental policy; gross national product; income; social evolution; urbanization; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; income; socioeconomics; statistical model; Greenhouse gases","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Greenhouse Gases, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801146)","Kai Sun acknowledges funding by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant ID number: 71801146 ).","Aichele R., Felbermayr G., Kyoto and the carbon footprint of nations, J.

We contribute to this area by (1) developing and empirically validating a multidimensional scale for civic engagement; (2) synthesizing and testing the adequacy of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the value–belief–norm (VBN) theory in explaining civic engagement; and (3) considering how an individual’s orientation, identity, and beliefs motivate moral thinking and action. The focus is on the important social issues of global warming and climate change, income inequality, and world poverty, and hunger. We follow both correlational and configurational approaches to examine symmetric and asymmetric causal relationships, respectively. The findings from a sample of 819 US citizens reveal that the TPB and VBN theory can adequately explain civic engagement, after we control for the influence of past experience. In addition, while belief in a just world inhibits the occurrence of adverse consequences and the formation of positive attitudes, social value orientation, and moral identity facilitate them. Notably, at least two causal conditions need to be present for adverse confsequences to emerge, while moral identity is almost a necessary condition for the development of positive attitudes. We conclude with a discussion of important implications for researchers and practitioners. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Civic engagement; Social issues; Sustainability","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/L011891/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior, (1980); Anderson J.L., Markides C., Kupp M., The last frontier: Market creation in conflict zones, deep rural areas, and urban slums, California Management Review, 52, 4, pp. 6-28, (2010); Civic engagement, American Psychological Association, (2018); Aquino K., Reed A., The self-importance of moral identity, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, 6, pp. 1423-1440, (2002); Armitage C.J., Conner M., Efficacy of the theory of planned behaviour: A meta-analytic review, British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, 4, pp. 471-499, (2001); Arnett D.B., German S.D., Hunt S.D., The identity salience model of relationship marketing success: The case of nonprofit marketing, Journal of Marketing, 67, 2, pp. 89-105, (2003); Ashkanasy N.M., Windsor C.A., Trevino L.K., Bad apples in bad barrels revisited: Cognitive moral development, just world beliefs, rewards, and ethical decision-making, Business Ethics Quarterly, 16, 4, pp. 449-473, (2006); Bamberg S., Hunecke M., Blobaum A., Social context, personal norms and the use of public transportation: Two field studies, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 27, 3, pp. 190-203, (2007); Barnett C., Cafaro P., Newholm T., Philosophy and ethical consumption, The ethical consumer, pp. 11-24, (2005); Begue L., Bastounis M., Two spheres of belief in justice: Extensive support for the bidimensional model of belief in a just world, Journal of Personality, 71, 3, pp. 435-463, (2003); Bekkers R., Wiepking P., A literature review of empirical studies of philanthropy: Eight mechanisms that drive charitable giving, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 40, 5, pp. 924-973, (2011); Berger J., Word of mouth and interpersonal communication: A review and directions for future research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 586-607, (2014); Bertrand M., Mullainathan S., Shafir E., Behavioral economics and marketing in aid of decision making among the poor, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 25, 1, pp. 8-23, (2006); Bhattacharya C.B., Sen S., Doing better at doing good: When, why, and how consumers respond to corporate social initiatives, California Management Review, 47, 1, pp. 9-24, (2004); Blair E., Zinkhan G.M., Nonresponse and generalizability in academic research, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 34, 1, pp. 4-7, (2006); Blasi A., Moral cognition and moral action: A theoretical perspective, Developmental Review, 3, 2, pp. 178-210, (1983); Bogaert S., Boone C., Declerck C., Social value orientation and cooperation in social dilemmas: A review and conceptual model, British Journal of Social Psychology, 47, 3, pp. 453-480, (2008); Buhrmester M., Kwang T., Gosling S.D., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 6, 1, pp. 3-5, (2011); Butterfield K.D., A review of the empirical ethical decision-making literature: 1996–2003, Journal of Business Ethics, 59, 4, pp. 375-413, (2005); Castaldo S., Perrini F., Misani N., Tencati A., The missing link between corporate social responsibility and consumer trust: The case of fair trade products, Journal of Business Ethics, 84, 1, pp. 1-15, (2009); Chowdhury R.M., Fernando M., The relationships of empathy, moral identity and cynicism with consumers’ ethical beliefs: The mediating role of moral disengagement, Journal of Business Ethics, 124, 4, pp. 677-694, (2014); Cohen J., The cost of dichotomization, Applied Psychological Measurement, 7, 3, pp. 249-253, (1983); Colby A., Ehrlich T., Beaumont E., Rosner J., Stephens J., Higher education and the development of civic responsibility, Civic responsibility and higher education, pp. 21-43, (2000); Conner M., Armitage C.J., Extending the theory of planned behavior: A review and avenues for further research, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 28, 15, pp. 1429-1464, (1998); Crawford E.R., LePine J.A., Rich B.L., Linking job demands and resources to employee engagement and burnout: A theoretical extension and meta-analytic test, Journal of Applied Psychology, 95, 5, pp. 834-848, (2010); Cronbach L.J., Coefficient alpha and the internal structure of tests, Psychometrika, 16, 3, pp. 297-334, (1951); De Dreu C.K.W., Boles T.L., Share and share alike or winner take all?

Those with better adaptation strategies (such as air conditioning) suffer less. This paper combines China's daily mean temperature data with comprehensive national survey data at the household level and estimates the relationship between high-temperature exposure and adaptation behavior of urban dwellers. We find that the usage of air conditioning and electric fans by urban households in China increases with their summer high-temperature exposures. The rise in the number of days with extreme heat (mean temperature exceeding 80 °F) induces the purchase and use of air conditioning. High-temperature adaptability varied across households—the rich are more likely to increase air conditioning usage to cope with the high-temperature discomfort; while the poor are less likely to afford such a market product for adaptation, they suffer more from high-temperature exposure. Such a variation in the affordability and usage of market products to adapt to climate risks will exacerbate the climate-induced inequality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air conditioning; China; Climate adaptation behavior; High-temperature exposure inequality; Income heterogeneity","Air Conditioning; China; Hot Temperature; Income; Socioeconomic Factors; Temperature; Urban Population; China; air conditioning; climate change; equity; household income; temperature effect; urban area; urban population; air conditioning; article; China; climate; extreme hot weather; heat shock; high temperature; household income; summer; China; heat; income; socioeconomics; temperature; urban population","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71625004, 71903210); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2017A030313446); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71625004 , 71903210 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2017A030313446 ) for the support.","Auffhammer M., Cooling China: the weather dependence of air conditioner adoption, Front.

Macroeconomic panel studies applying region and time fixed effects (FE) regression models and measuring inequality by the Gini coefficient discovered a flat relationship. Only two of these studies substituting Gini by the more appropriate share held by the top 10 percent of the income or wealth distribution find a positive effect. This paper revisits this nexus and challenges the empirical validity of the contribution of an increase in wealth and income inequality to higher CO2 emissions lately found by Knight et al. (2017) on country-level and by Jorgenson et al. (2017) on U.S. state-level. The positive inequality effects spotted in these two studies are not robust with respect to the regions and time spans observed as well as to the inequality indicators, estimation techniques, and confounders selected. Hence, this in-depth investigation suggests that there is no sound empirical evidence for a substantial nexus between social inequality and CO2 emissions. After all, lately proposed policy approaches combining efficient cap-and trade programs with income and wealth redistribution (so-called cap-and-dividend schemes) are not, by themselves, suitable for an effective climate policy. In fact, the analysis points at the relevance of treating key predictors of CO2 emissions including energy prices for the U.S. for effective climate change mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Fixed effects panel regression; Income inequality; Wealth inequality","carbon dioxide; Article; carbon footprint; empirical research; human; income; pollution; priority journal; social aspect; social inequality; socioeconomics","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4","","","","","Afionis S., Sakai M., Scott K., Barrett J., Gouldson A., Consumption-based carbon accounting: does it have a future?, WIREs Clim.

One of the effective approaches is the energy/emissions embodied in bilateral trade (EEBT) aiming to locate the destination of energy bi-directionally to evaluate how energy flow between producer and consumer sectors. However, in addition to the flow of energy and resources, the topological structure and impact of underlying components from a system science perspective are equally important for policy-making. This study therefore constructs an energy embodied in trade network (EETN) model to track multi-layer primary energy flow by integrating the EEBT approach and complex network analysis. The embodied coal, oil, natural gas, and non-fossil fuels associated with China's 30 provinces/municipalities are quantified at the provincial level. By the joint analysis of the network-oriented metrics, the EETN model elicits the possibility of understanding the heterogeneity distribution of different types of energy flow and the potential impact of province-specific policy interventions. We explain how resource endowment, economic growth, income inequality, cross-provincial industrial transfer, and infrastructures affect China's provincial energy embodiments as well as the clustering features. Other findings and policy recommendations are also presented. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Communities; Complex network theory; EEBT; Primary energy","Climate change; Commerce; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economics; Ecosystems; China; Complex network approaches; EEBT; Effective approaches; Policy recommendations; Primary energies; Topological structure; Underlying components; Complex networks","","","","","National University of Singapore, NUS; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71473108); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201608320273)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71473108 ).

The chapter discusses some of the challenges that the world is currently confronting in addition to environmental degradation and climate change: rising income and wealth concentration, with social exclusion and the marginalization of many segments of the population. This is a trend in developed and developing countries alike. The chapter deals with the growth and impact of global capitalism and discusses the imperative of inclusive development policies to address and fi nd solutions to these issues. Alternative measures of economic and social progress are discussed. The chapter also looks at social innovation and social entrepreneurship and discusses why these concepts are different from traditional ways of looking at innovations. Finally, the chapter looks at the growth of the so-called Third Sector and discusses to what extent it can deliver innovational solutions to social problems, where both the business sector and the public sector have failed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Democratization of innovation; Inclusive development; Income inequalities; Social innovation; Sustainable development; Third Sector","","","","","","","","Altenburg T., Building inclusive innovation systems in developing countries: Challenges for IS research, Handbook of innovation systems and developing countries, (2009); Amsden A., The rise of ‘the rest’.

This study examines the short-term consumption-side distributional impacts of expanding low-carbon electric supply in the state of Maharashtra, India with a focus on the influence of regulatory discretion in pricing. Households' welfare impacts from economy-wide electricity price shocks are simulated against a baseline that is calibrated to actual household economic and electricity service conditions, including actual electricity budgets, block tier prices and supply rationing. Industrial price impacts are propagated to households using a Leontief input-output analysis. Regulatory pricing decisions are evaluated based on social welfare metrics for economic efficiency and income inequality. The analysis reveals new linkages between climate change mitigation, electricity policy and income distribution. Low-income households can be shielded from mitigation impacts without losses in aggregate welfare to the extent that regulators can recover mitigation costs through industrial price increases. Regulators' flexibility to distribute costs across households is constrained by industrial customers' migration off the grid. Reduced supply interruptions to the rural poor from the resulting demand contraction are a potential co-benefit of mitigation. Distributional impacts, therefore, depend on other electricity policies that are driven by the political economy of the sector. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Electricity policy; India","India; Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electricity; Industry; Climate change mitigation; Electricity policy; Electricity service; Income distribution; India; Industrial customer; Input output analysis; Maharashtra , India; climate change; climate effect; demand analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy policy; environmental economics; environmental policy; governance approach; household energy; input-output analysis; low income population; policy implementation; political economy; Costs","","","","","Program on Energy and Sustainable Development; Stanford University, SU","I am grateful for the financial support from the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development, Stanford University, for this research.

Wars between states are fought less frequently and are less lethal. Food is more plentiful and more easily accessed. In most parts of the world, birthrates are down and life expectancy up. Significantly fewer people live in extreme poverty, relative to the overall population. Statistics would argue that the human race has never before flourished as it has in this moment. And yet, even with this progress, we face a number of seemingly intractable challenges to the welfare of both states and individuals, including: Governmental instability undermining the lives of citizens, both within and beyond their borders; Persistent and recurring intrastate conflict due to ineffective conflict management strategies; Marginally successful development efforts and growing income inequality, both within and between nations, as a result of uncoordinated and ineffective global development strategies; Internecine conflict in multiethnic societies, manifested by exclusion, discrimination, and ultimately violence, the inevitable consequence of an insufficient focus on managing the inherent tensions in diverse societies; Global climate change with the possibility of catastrophic long-term consequences, following an inability to effectively come to terms with and respond to the impact of human activity on our environment. These challenges require a newly collaborative, intentional, and systematic approach. This book offers a blueprint for how to get there, calling for increased leadership responsibility, clarity of mission, and empowerment of states and individuals. It is designed to transform lofty but often vague agendas into concrete, measurable progress. It believes in the capacity of humanity to rise to the occasion, to come together to address these increasingly critical global problems, and offers one way forward. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

These dense concentrations of population, economic activity, and consumption—the majority of which are in the Global South—are often extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea level rise and extreme weather. This paper unpacks these complexities through a case study of Metropolitan Manila, the capital of the Philippines, which represents an example of “double exposure” to climate change impacts and globalization. The city is experiencing tremendous population and economic growth, yet Manila is plagued by frequent natural disasters, congestion, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, and income inequality. The need for metro-wide planning and infrastructure transformations to address these problems is widely recognized, but governance challenges are a major barrier. Drawing on fieldwork, interviews, and other primary and secondary sources, I argue that climate change and globalization, in combination with Manila’s historical and physical context, critically shape metro-wide infrastructure planning. Focusing on electricity and green infrastructure, I find that the largely decentralized and privatized urban governance regime is perpetuating a fragmented and unequal city, which may undermine urban climate resilience. This study extends the double exposure framework to examine how global processes interact with contextual factors to critically shape urban infrastructure planning, and how the resulting system conforms to theorized characteristics of urban climate resilience. In doing so, I help to connect emerging literatures on double exposure, urban infrastructure planning, and urban climate resilience. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Climate change adaptation; globalization; megacities; urban infrastructure planning; urban resilience","Manila; National Capital Region; Philippines; adaptive management; climate change; decentralization; globalization; governance approach; infrastructure planning; megacity; urban economy; urban planning; vulnerability","","","","","Marshall Weinberg Population","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author(s) would like to thank Marshall Weinberg Population, Development, and Climate Change Fellowship, the Rackham International Research Grant, and the Menakka and Essel Bailey Fellowship for funding the research.","Adger W.N., Vulnerability, Global Environmental Change, 16, 3, pp. 268-281, (2006); Ahern J., Green infrastructure for cities: The spatial dimension, Cities of the Future: Towards Integrated Sustainable Water and Landscape Management, pp. 268-283, (2007); Ahern J., From fail-safe to safe-to-fail: Sustainability and resilience in the new urban world, Landscape and Urban Planning, 100, 4, pp. 341-343, (2011); City resilience index: City resilience framework.

Most burden-sharing proposals for climate mitigation treat states as homogenous agents, even those that aim to protect individual rights. This can lead to free riders in some large emerging economies and expose the poor to mitigation burdens in others. Proposals that incorporate an exemption for the poor can avoid these outcomes, but do not account for the role of internal policies on the poor's actual emissions and mitigation burdens. This will create moral hazards in the design of such agreements and risk the misallocation of mitigation costs when implemented. To ensure equitable outcomes at the individual level, international agreements would need to build in additional provisions to encourage benefiting states to reduce emissions and target exemptions to the poor. But such agreements will face political conflicts over sovereignty and the burdensomeness of such provisions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate equity; Environmental agreements; Global justice; Income inequality","climate change; environmental policy; equity; global climate; income distribution; international agreement; mitigation","","","","","","","Agarwal A., Narain S., Green Politics: Global Environmental Negotiations, (1991); Baer P., Athanasiou T., Kartha S., Kemp-Benedict E., The Greenhouse development rights framework: The right to development in a climate Constrained world, (2008); Caney S., Climate change, human rights, and moral thresholds, Human Rights and Climate Change, (2009); Caney S., Justice and the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions, Journal of Global Ethics, 5, 2, pp. 125-146, (2009); Caney S., Climate change and the duties of the advantaged, Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, 13, 1, pp. 203-228, (2010); Chakravarty S., Chikkatur A., de Coninck H., Pacala S., Socolow R., Tavoni M., Sharing global CO2 emission reductions among one billion high emitters, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, 29, pp. 11884-11888, (2009); Chen J.R., Sapsford D., Global Development and Poverty Reduction: The Challenge for International Institutions (International Institutions and Global Governance), (2005); Clapp J., Wilkinson R., Global Governance, Poverty and Inequality (Global Institutions), (2010); Claussen E., McNeilly L., Equity & Global Climate Change: The Complex Elements of Global Fairness, (1998); Conca K., Rethinking the ecology-sovereignty debate, Millennium-Journal of International Studies, 23, 3, pp. 701-711, (1994); den Elzen M., Hohne N., Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in Annex I and non-Annex I countries for meeting concentration stabilisation targets, Climatic Change, 91, 3, pp. 249-274, (2008); Diringer E., Climate policy: Letting go of Kyoto, Nature, 479, 7373, pp. 291-292, (2011); Frankel J., Formulas for quantitative emissions targets, Architectures for Agreement: Addressing Global Climate Change in the Post-Kyoto World, (2007); Gardiner S., Ethics and global climate change, Ethics, 114, pp. 555-600, (2004); Gardiner S., Caney S., Jamieson D., Shue H., Climate Ethics: Essential Readings, (2010); Gordon R.H., Li W., Tax structure in developing countries: Many puzzles and a possible explanation, (2005); Grasso M., A normative ethical framework in climate change, Climatic Change, 81, 3, pp. 223-246, (2007); Haas P.M., Keohane R.O., Levy M.A., Institutions for the Earth: Sources of Effective International Environmental Protection, (1993); Herring R.J., International justice, poverty and the environment, (1999); Jamieson D., Climate change and global environmental justice, Changing the Atmosphere: Expert Knowledge and Global Environmental Governance, (2001); Jiahua P., Chen Y., Wang W., Li C., Carbon Budget Proposal, Global Emissions under Carbon Budget Constraint on an Individual Basis for an Equitable and Sustainable Post 2012 International Climate Regime, (2008); Kanitkar T., Jayaraman T., D'Souza M., Sanwal M., Purkayastha P., Talwar R., Meeting equity in a finite carbon world: Global carbon budgets and burden sharing in mitigation actions, (2009); Kant P., Chaliha S., Shuirong W., The REDD Safeguards of Cancun, (2011); Klinsky S., Dowlatabadi H., Conceptualizations of justice in climate policy, Climate Policy, 9, pp. 88-108, (2009); Komives K., Foster V., Halpern J., Wodon Q., Water, Electricity, and the Poor: Who Benefits from Utility Subsidies?, (2005); Litfin K.T., Sovereignty in world ecopolitics, Mershon International Studies Review, 41, 2, pp. 167-204, (1997); Lopez J.H., Serven L., A Normal relationship?

The region suffers from high unemployment (especially among women and youth), poor education, high levels of income inequality, gender discrimination, underdeveloped infrastructure, a weak financial sector, continuous trade protectionism, and a poor business climate. In addition, recent political turmoil in several countries has negatively affected their GDP dynamics and business climate; political stability is a precondition for other policies to bring about positive results. The SEMC should conduct comprehensive reforms of their economic, social and political systems with the aim of ensuring macroeconomic stability, increasing trade, investment and financial openness, deepening financial intermediation, improving the business climate and governance system, and upgrading their infrastructure and human capital. The EU can actively support this modernization agenda through liberalizing trade in sensitive sectors (agriculture and services), adopting a more flexible approach to SEMC labor migration, implementing aid programs aimed at improving infrastructure, raising educational outcomes, promoting science and culture and addressing environmental and climate change risks.

Literature indicates several factors behind the lack of adoption including socio-demographic and economic conditions, agro-ecological scales and the nature of the practices. This paper examines to what extent and under which conditions such factors influence the adoption of CSA practices at farm, household and community level across three study sites in different continents: Vietnam, Nicaragua and Uganda. While cost benefit analysis (CBA) is employed to assess the farm-level profitability of CSA practices, the aggregate community impact disaggregated by different groups of farmer typologies with specific socio-economic features is derived from the adoption rate estimated by the relative advantage of practices and the income level of each group. Our main findings show great variation of farm-profitability of CSA practices across scales. Similar practices could generate different profitability depending on crop typologies, input access and prices, household types and local context. Regarding the aggregate profitability of CSA practices at regional scale, we found that under particular conditions, relevant factors of adoption matter to the adoption pattern and thereby affects the ranking. Such conditions include (i) high income inequality, (ii) large profitability gap of prioritized CSA practices, and (iii) large proportion of cost and benefit of the practices in the level of income. This study contributes to enhancing the prioritization process of CSA practices and provides practical guidance for research and policy to tailor the investment to appropriate end-users to assure the greatest impact for the community. © 2018 Lan et al.

Some research suggests these goals are in conflict, based largely on the observation that a dollar spent at higher income levels is less carbon intensive than at lower income levels. We put this concern to rest. We quantify this effect in its most extreme manifestation, both within countries and between countries. We use a wide range of income elasticities of emissions (0.7–1.0) and scenarios from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) with the highest (SSP4) and lowest (SSP5) between-country inequality. Within countries, even with assumptions of low elasticities (0.7) and aggressive inequality reduction (Gini coefficient of 0.55 to 0.30), emissions would realistically increase by less than 8%, which would likely occur over several decades. Income convergence between countries may reduce the emissions intensity of global income growth, because the energy intensity reductions from income growth in emerging economies, such as India and China, offsets the energy increasing effect of higher growth in developing countries. Given these findings, it seems a distraction for future research to dwell on this narrow framing when there are deeper under-explored linkages and synergies between reducing income inequality and climate change, such as the effect of reducing inequality on social norms, consumption and on political mobilization around climate policy.

Despite significant gains in socio-economic development since its transition to democracy, the country continues to face the triple challenges of rising unemployment, income inequality and poverty - amid a slowdown in economic growth. Sustainability transitions offer new ways of shifting the trajectory of South Africa’s resource-intensive economy towards low-carbon pathways linked to the country’s transformative development agenda. Calls for inclusive approaches to greening the South African economy, which addresses the most vulnerable in society and ensures that the benefits of sustainability innovations reach all South Africans, are becoming more pronounced as sustainable development policy reforms are being implemented. The question that should be placed centre stage in South Africa’s sustainability discourse is whether notions of justice and inclusivity are being sufficiently addressed in the design and implementation of policy and programme interventions. This book explores South Africa’s sustainability transition through reflections on critical policy, economic, technological, social and environmental drivers. It provides a synthesis of theoretical insights, including new models and concepts, and praxis through illustrations from South Africa’s growing landscape of sustainable development policies and programmes. Finally, it assesses whether these transition pathways are beginning to reconfigure the system-level structures hindering the country’s goal of ‘ensuring environmental sustainability and an equitable transition to a low-carbon economy’. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Najma Mohamed.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-135174963-3; 978-113872799-1","","","English","Sustainability Transitions in South Africa","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059169937"

Interior settings affect occupants’ health and behavior through their design, and chemical, microbial, and social features. The initial portion of this paper describes ecological psychologists’ conceptions of indoor environments as self-contained and distinctly bounded ecobehavioral systems, with evidence for the behavioral and health effects of homes, workplaces, and other kinds of indoor ecosystems cited. The ensuing sections examine contemporary changes in the structure and functioning of indoor ecosystems propelled by the digitalization of society, global climate change, and sociodemographic shifts toward population aging, income inequality, and anti-immigrant views in many countries. Transdisciplinary action research is needed to understand and manage rapid changes in indoor ecosystems, as evidenced by the increasing permeability of their spatial and temporal boundaries, modifications of their structural features, and shifts in the distribution of certain categories of settings within host communities. Effective collaboration among academic and nonacademic partners spanning diverse fields and multiple environmental scales is likewise essential for developing broad-gauged solutions to enhance the healthfulness and sustainability of indoor ecosystems as they continue to evolve in future years. © 2018, Society for Human Ecology.

This study attempts to examine the linkage between the two factors for the individual BRICS economies from a comparative perspective, which is scarce in the literature. It examines the selected countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) by endogenising the patterns of primary energy consumption (coal use and petroleum use), total primary energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanisation as key determining factors in CO2 emission function. The long-run results based on ARDL bounds testing revealed that income inequality leads to increase in CO2 emissions for Brazil, India and China, while the same factor leads to reduction in CO2 emissions for South Africa. However, it observes that while coal use increases CO2 emissions for India, China and South Africa, it has no effect for Brazil. In contrast, the use of petroleum products contributes to CO2 emissions in Brazil, while the use of the same surprisingly results in reduction of carbon emissions in South Africa, India and China. The findings suggest that given the significance of income inequality in environmental pollution, the policy makers in these emerging economies have to take into consideration the role of income inequality, while designing the energy policy to achieve environmental sustainability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","BRICS; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Growth; Income inequality; Pattern of energy use; Urbanisation","Brazil; Carbon Dioxide; China; Climate Change; Coal; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution; Fossil Fuels; Income; India; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants; Public Policy; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; Urbanization; Brazil; China; India; South Africa; carbon dioxide; coal; fossil fuel; carbon emission; comparative study; economic growth; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental quality; income distribution; pollution policy; sustainability; urbanization; Brazil; China; climate change; comparative study; economic development; electric power plant; environmental policy; income; India; pollution; public policy; socioeconomics; South Africa; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; urbanization","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, ; Coal, ; Fossil Fuels, ","","","","","Abid M., The close relationship between informal economic growth and carbon emissions in Tunisia since 1980: the (ir) relevance of structural breaks, Sustainable Cities and Society, 15, pp. 11-21, (2015); Ahmad A., Zhao Y., Shahbaz M., Bano S., Zhang Z., Wang S., Liu Y., Carbon emissions, energy consumption and economic growth: an aggregate and disaggregate analysis of the Indian economy, Energy Policy, 96, pp. 131-143, (2016); Akin C.S., The impact of foreign trade, energy consumption and income on Co2 emissions, Int J Energy Econ Policy, 4, 3, (2014); Antle J.M., Heidebrink G., Environment and development: theory and international evidence, Econ Dev Cult Chang, 43, 3, pp. 603-625, (1995); Arvin-Mark B., Pradhan R.P., Norman N.R., Transportation intensity, urbanization, economic growth, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the G-20 countries, Util Policy, 35, pp. 50-66, (2015); Baek J., Gweisah G., Does income inequality harm the environment?

Reconciling the development and environment imperatives needs to become an urgent priority for the Chinese government in order to avert the cascading implications that will arise in terms of social unrest, loss of further development opportunities as well as deepening income inequality. This paper thus examines the inter-relationship between the current ecological challenge in China and the need for economic sustainability. It evaluates the extent of environmental damage in China and focuses on the environmental impact on development and social inequality. The paper then examines the recent legislative measures that have been taken by the Chinese government to address the problem of inefficient environmental monitoring. The author suggests that further reform is needed to achieve an economically and ecologically just pathway for China's future. The paper therefore demonstrates that the environment-development challenge in China is mainly a challenge of governance. Resolving it will contribute to better environmental justice and development. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.","China; climate change; sustainable development","","","","","","","","OECD Highlights Chinese Pollution, (2006); Environment and Health in the People's Republic of China, (2007); The Relationship between the People's Congresses, the State Administrative Organs, the People's Courts and People's Procuratorates, Central People's Government; Arnold C., Fourth-generation environmental law: Integrationist and multimodal, William & Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review, 35, (2010); Balme R., The Politics of Environmental Justice in China, (2011); Cao J., Garbaccio R., Ho M.S., China's 11th five-year plan and the environment: Reducing so2 emissions, Environmental Economic Policy, 3, 2, (2009); Chan S., Human rights in China and the United States: Competing visions and discrepant performances, Human Rights.

First the article outlines agriculture’s connection with overall economic growth; then, the author evaluates agricultural productivity and food security in Africa in 2010. From this point, the author evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of seven paths that African agriculture is likely to evolve along between now and 2050: five for Sub-Saharan African and two for North Africa. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the types of farming proposed are: extensive, mechanized; intensive export; intensive peri-urban; subsistence; and reserves, game ranching, and tourism. In North Africa, the author proposes: irrigated and rainfed. In order to realize the most positive benefits of these paths in 2050, Africa has to tackle six challenges, outlined by the author: reducing population growth, promoting irrigation, adapting the role of the state, promoting the acceleration of technical change (including fertilizer and biotechnology), and preparing for climate change. Increasing the competitiveness of Africa’s commercial farming will improve income, inequality, and nutrition across the continent. © 2014, © 2014 Emerging Markets Forum.","Africa; agriculture; climate change; fertilizer; population growth; technology","","","","","","","","Aker J.C., Information from markets near and far: Mobile phones and agricultural markets in Niger, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 2, 3, pp. 46-59, (2010); Alexandratos N., Bruinsma J., World agriculture toward 2030/2050: The 2012 revision.

The article proceeds to argue that current cohorts of young people in all Western countries will become the vanguard of a successor generation, distinguished by a different youth life stage and also by different characteristic experience of adulthood and, eventually, a different politics than the generation's predecessor. It is argued that the new generation's situation arose initially within the working classes and has now spread upwards. The article suggests that this new trend is unlikely to be reversed on account of (1) economic growth rates in Western countries slowing since the three decades that immediately followed the Second World War; (2) labour's declining share of gross domestic product and wider income inequalities within countries; (3) costs of imported commodities will most likely continue to rise; (4) new cohorts of workers will have to bear some of the costs of supporting swollen cohorts of retired citizens, tackling pollution and alleviating climate change; (5) the costs of raising children are likely to continue to rise and new cohorts of workers will most likely need to make some private provisions for their own health care and retirement incomes; (6) there are now excessive numbers of higher education graduates in all world regions relative to the number of graduate jobs; and (7) the changing class demography in West Europe and North America.

We establish that the coal, metal ores and the platinum group commodity sectors will underpin the mining as a ""sunrise"" industry. The export-led growth strategy is necessary for intensive employment creation but must be complemented by other micro, macroeconomic and industrial policies. A strategy of minerals beneficiation is important for intensive employment creation. Accelerated land reform is a supply side or structural reform policy intervention tool aimed at increasing potential output, changing ownership patterns in the economy, increasing entrepreneurship, labour absorption, economic inclusion and lowering income inequality. Evidence shows that the balance sheet channel, commodity price booms and busts are intricately linked with the exchange rate dynamics, policy uncertainty, confidence and the effects of droughts (also symptoms of climate change). Productivity and investment growth shocks matter for output, employment and price stability. Evidence indicates that nominal GDP growth above 10 percent and keeping inflation within the target band leads to significant increase in employment and decline in unemployment, without inflationary pressures, especially when inflation is below 4.5 percent. To operationalise the NDP targets, align and co-ordinate policies, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) mandate can be expanded to include maximum employment. This must be complemented by lowering the inflation target band, adjusting the financial regulatory, macro-prudential and monetary policy frameworks. This will enhance the conduct and credibility of monetary and financial stability policies to achieve the set objectives. These objectives make policy co-ordination pertinent and binding.  © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","BRICS GDP growth shocks; Equity flows; Exchange rate appreciation and depreciation; Expansionary monetary policy; Export-led growthCommodity price booms; Federal funds rate; Foreign economic growth uncertainty; InflationAggregate demand shocks; Monetary policy tightening shocks; Okun's LawWage growth; Output growth volatility; Output-employment-unemployment nexus in South Africa; Repo rate; South African GDP growth; South African labor market conditions; Taylor curve; Wage and consumer price inflation","","","","","","","","Ancharaz V., Trade, Jobs and Growth in Africa: An Empirical Investigation of the Export-Led Jobless Growth Hypothesis, African Development Bank, (2011); Autor D.H., Dorn D., Hanson G.H., The China Shock: Learning from Labour Market Adjustment to Large Changes in Trade, (2016); The Contribution of the Agro-Industrial Complex to Employment in South Africa, Tech.

To evaluate impacts of solar geoengineering and greenhouse gas-driven climate change on equal terms, we apply macroeconomic impact models that have been widely applied to climate change impacts assessment. Combining historical evidence with climate simulations of mean annual temperature and precipitation, we project socio-economic outcomes under high anthropogenic emissions for stylized climate scenarios in which global temperatures are stabilized or over-cooled by blocking solar radiation. We find impacts of climate changes on global GDP-per-capita by the end of the century are temperature-driven, highly dispersed, and model dependent. Across all model specifications, however, income inequality between countries is lower with solar geoengineering. Consistent reduction in inter-country inequality can inform discussions of the distribution of impacts of solar geoengineering, a topic of concern in geoengineering ethics and governance debates. © 2020, The Author(s).","","anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic source; climate change; econometrics; economic impact; environmental impact assessment; heterogeneity; model; precipitation (climatology); socioeconomic conditions; solar radiation; temperature effect; Article; climate change; economic aspect; economic development; engineering and technology; environmental impact; evolution; greenhouse gas; human; income; precipitation; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; simulation; socioeconomics; solar radiation; temperature","","","","","A.H.; Canada Research Chairs","The authors thank Sikina Jinnah and David Victor for helpful input on the global governance implications of this paper.

Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature, while poor countries respond only linearly. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human-natural systems and to anticipating the global impact of climate change. Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is non-linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13°C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change, with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate. ©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This work argues that income inequality may also predict higher levels of vulnerability of urban municipalities to climate-related hazards. Method: Using factor analysis and multilevel regression models, this research tests whether income inequality is a predictor of vulnerability to flood hazards. Results: The analysis shows that income inequality significantly predicts higher levels of a key component of vulnerability in urban Brazilian municipalities. Conclusion: By providing empirical evidence for the theorized linkages between income inequality, spatial segregation, and uneven public resource access, this work bolsters the claims of income inequality scholars who suggest high levels of income inequality have negative social consequences. Additionally, this work is relevant to climate change vulnerability scholars as it underscores the importance of considering income inequality as part of urban climate change vulnerability assessments. © 2016 by the Southwestern Social Science Association","","","","","","","","","Adger W.N., Social Vulnerability to Climate Change and Extremes in Coastal Vietnam, World Development, 27, 2, pp. 249-269, (1999); Allison P.D., Measures of Inequality, American Sociological Review, 43, 6, pp. 865-880, (1978); Atkinson A.B., On the Measurement of Inequality, Journal of Economic Theory, 2, pp. 244-263, (1970); Baptista S., Adamo S., A Spatial Analysis of the 2008 Itajaí River Valley Disaster, (2014); Barbieri A.F., Domingues E., Queiroz B.L., Ruiz R.M., Jose I., Jose R., Carvalho A.M., Resende M.F., Climate Change and Population Migration in Brazil's Northeast: Scenarios for 2025–2050, Population and Environment, 31, 5, pp. 344-370, (2010); Barnett J., Lambert S., Fry I., The Hazards of Indicators: Insights from the Environmental Vulnerability Index, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 98, 1, pp. 102-119, (2008); Birkmann J., Measuring Vulnerability to Natural Hazards: Towards Disaster Resilient Societies, (2006); Brooks N., Neil Adger W., Mick Kelly P., The Determinants of Vulnerability and Adaptive Capacity at the National Level and the Implications for Adaptation, Global Environmental Change, 15, 2, pp. 151-163, (2005); Cardoso F.H., Roberts T.J., Hite A.B., Dependency and Development in Latin America, The Globalization and Development Reader, pp. 85-94, (1972); Charles-Coll J.A., Understanding Income Inequality: Concept, Causes and Measurement, International Journal of Economics and Management Sciences, 1, 3, pp. 17-28, (2011); Global Aridity and Global PET-–Methodology, Consortium for Spatial Information, (2012); Coulter F., Cowell F., Jenkins S., Equivalence Scale Relativities and the Extent of Inequality and Poverty, Economic Journal, 102, pp. 1067-1082, (1992); Cutter S.L., Boruff B.J., Lynn Shirley W., Social Vulnerability to Environmental Hazards, Social Science Quarterly, 84, 2, pp. 242-261, (2003); Da S., Rodrigues A.N., Costa M.D.S., Macedo M.H., Multiple Views of Sustainable Urban Mobility: The Case of Brazil, Transport Policy, 15, 6, pp. 350-360, (2008); Da V., Valeria G., Cunha A.S.D., Sichieri R., Trends in Overweight Among Adolescents Living in the Poorest and Richest Regions of Brazil, American Journal of Public Health, 94, 9, (2004); Deaton A., The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality, (2013); Brazil County Profile—Natural Disasters, (2014); De M., Income Inequality Measures, Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, 61, 10, pp. 849-852, (2007); Top Ten Natural Disasters in Brazil, (2014); Font M., Transforming Brazil: A Reform Era in Perspective, (2003); Frank R.H., Falling Behind: How Rising Inequality Harms the Middle Class, (2007); Friedman E.J., Hochstetler K., Assessing the Third Transition in Latin American Democratization: Representational Regimes and Civil Society in Argentina and Brazil, Comparative Politics, 35, 1, pp. 21-42, (2002); Flood Frequency, (2011); Goldsmith W.W., Participatory Budgeting in Brazil, (1999); Hardoy J.E., Mitlin D., Satterthwaite D., Environmental Problems in an Urbanizing World, (2001); Hervitz H.M., Selectivity, Adaptation, or Disruption?

These themes include rationales for shifts in attention to environmental issues, and interfaces of media, public, and official agendas, including ontological perspectives on just what environmental journalism is. In many cases, the reporting only surfaces when an environmental issue has become a real crisis. Another trend was the importance of individual impetus in becoming a newsroom entrepreneur who can push environmental issues past gatekeepers. By highlighting the shortcomings and successes of media in Latin America, the authors conclude by making a call to practitioners and scholars to address the identified limitations and advance environmental journalism in the region. © 2018, The Author(s).","Acknowledge Climate Change; Continental Latin America; Deepening Income Inequality; Environmental Journalism; Restricting Corporations","","","","","","","","de Freitas C., Marston A.J., Bakker K., Not-quite-neoliberal natures in Latin America: An introduction, Geoforum, 64, pp. 239-245, (2020); Gligo N., Dimension ambiental en el desarrollo de América Latina.

Specifically, it provides an ex-ante assessment that the impacts of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted under the Paris Agreement, will have on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)of poverty eradication (SDG1)and reduced income inequality (SDG10). Through this research we aim at answering the following questions: does mitigation policy always imply a trade-off with development objectives? If this is the case, what is the magnitude of the effect of the new international climate architecture on poverty and inequality? By combining an empirical analysis with a modelling exercise, the paper estimates the future trends of poverty prevalence and inequality across countries in a reference scenario and under a climate mitigation policy with alternative revenue recycling schemes. Our study finds that a full implementation of the emission reduction contributions, stated in the NDCs, is projected to slow down the effort to reduce poverty by 2030 (+4.2% of the population below the poverty line compared to the baseline scenario), especially in countries that have proposed relatively more stringent mitigation targets and suffer higher policy costs. Conversely, the impact of climate policy on inequality shows opposite sign but remains very limited. If financial support for mitigation action in developing countries is provided through an international climate fund, the prevalence of poverty will be slightly reduced at the aggregate level, but the country-specific effect depends on the relative size of funds flowing to beneficiary countries and on their economic structure. The output of our analysis contributes to the emerging literature on the linkages between climate change policy and sustainable development, although we capture only partially the complex system of interrelations and feedbacks proper of the SDGs. Moreover, due to its policy relevance, it further enriches the debate on the implementation of the Paris Agreement and its climate finance tools. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CGE model; Inequality; Mitigation policy; Paris agreement; Poverty; SDGs","France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; economic structure; environmental economics; environmental policy; income distribution; policy implementation; poverty; sustainable development; targeting; trade-off","","","","","Research Executive Agency, REA; FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions; European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (609642, FP7/2007-2013/)","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to Enrica De Cian, Johannes Emmerling, Henry Lee, Ramiro Parrado and Francesco Vona for feedback on an earlier draft of this article as well as to three anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

However, few studies have investigated those links in developing countries. This paper explores the role of income inequality in the per capita emission of CO2 in Latin America. We estimate the impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions, while simultaneously considering national income levels. The results suggest quadratic relationships between environmental impact and both gross domestic product per capita and inequality. Income inequality influences CO2 emissions, but the direction depends on income level. The complexities of the results are analytically explored in the paper. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon emissions; climate change; environmental impact; income inequality","Latin America; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; environmental economics; environmental impact; income distribution","","","","","","","Al-Mulali U., Tang C.F., Ozturk I., Estimating the environment Kuznets curve hypothesis: evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean countries, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 50, pp. 918-924, (2015); Arellano M., Bond S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, The Review of Economic Studies, 58, pp. 227-297, (1991); Azevedo J.P., Lopez-Calva L.F., Lustig N., Ortiz-Juarez E., Inequality, mobility and middle classes in Latin America, Latin America's Emerging Middle Classes, pp. 32-50, (2015); Barcena A., Prado A., Samaniego J., Perez R., The economics of climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean: paradoxes and challenges, (2014); Beck K.A., Joshi P., An analysis of the environmental Kuznets curve for carbon dioxide emissions: evidence for OECD and non-OECD countries, European Journal of Sustainable Development, 4, pp. 33-45, (2015); Berthe A., Elie L., Mechanisms explaining the impact of economic inequality on environmental deterioration, Ecological Economics, 116, pp. 191-200, (2015); Blundell R., Bond D., Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models, Journal of Econometrics, 8, pp. 115-143, (1998); Boden T., Global, regional, and national fossil-fuel CO2 emissions, (2017); Borghesi S., Income inequality and the environmental Kuznets curve, Environment, inequality and collective action, 33, (2006); Boyce J.K., Inequality as a cause of environmental degradation, Ecological Economics, 11, pp. 169-178, (1994); Clement M., Meunie A., Is inequality harmful for the environment?

In an era of income inequality, needed reforms in the criminal justice system, threats to voting rights and human rights, and major debate about the role of government in health care, education, social services, housing, climate change, jobs, wages, and other keystones of society, nonprofits have a responsibility to be involved.

To understand why, Carey King explores the scientific and rhetorical basis of the competing narratives both within and between energy technology and economics. © All rights reserved.","Climate change management; Climate change mitigation; Debt and income inequality; Energy and food costs; Fossil vs renewable energy; Inaccurate economic models; Sustainable economic growth","","","","","","","","Ayres R.U., Sustainability economics: Where do we stand, Ecological Economics, 67, 2, pp. 281-310, (2008); Ayres R.U., Warr B., Accounting for growth: The role of physical work, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 16, pp. 181-209, (2005); Brown T., Bischof-Niemz T., Blok K., Breyer C., Lund H., Mathiesen B., Response to burden of proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 92, pp. 834-847, (2018); Clack C.T.M., Qvist S.A., Apt J., Bazilian M., Brandt A.R., Caldeira K., Davis S.J., Diakov V., Handschy M.A., Hines P.D.H., Jaramillo P., Kammen D.M., Long J.C.S., Morgan M.G., Reed A., Sivaram V., Sweeney J., Tynan G.R., Victor D.G., Weyant J.P., Whitacre J.F., Evaluation of a proposal for reliable low-cost grid power with 100% wind, water, and solar, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114, 26, (2017); Annual energy review 2011, (2012); Global Energy Assessment-Toward a Sustainable Future, (2012); Giampietro M., Mayumi K., Orman A.H., Energy Analysis for a Sustainable Future: Multiscale integrated analysis of societal and ecosystem metabolism, (2013); Energy statistics manual.

However, people living in the riverine areas are more vulnerable to riverbank erosion and other climateinduced hazards, which may have persistent effects on their livelihood and food security. This paper explores household food security vulnerability due to riverbank erosion using the survey data from 380 riverbank erosion-prone households in Bangladesh. A Food Security Index is developed with value ranges between 3 to 1; 3 indicating the most food secure and 1 food insecure. Results reveal significant income inequality among the study households. Land loss due to riverbank erosion curtails food production and income generation, and low income reduces household purchasing power. More than half (56%) of households fall into the food insecure category with an average per capita calorie consumption of 1867 kcal/day. The overall indexed value is 2.15 indicating a household’s inability to manage family food requirements throughout the year to be regarded as food secure. The households depending on agriculture for their livelihoods are the most vulnerable to food insecurity. Context specific policy interventions are required to control riverbank erosion through structural and non-structural measures for improving food security in riverine island areas. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, none of the previous researches reviewed the empirical studies of relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions. The authors of the selected papers, published from 2001 to 2019, found a diverse impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It could depend on different trajectories of Kuznets curves. Furthermore, the majority of authors have provided theoretical analysis (even including human behaviour) of the influence of income inequality on CO2 emissions, considering only territorial (or production-based) emissions. However, this paper recommends to distinguish between the production-based and consumption-based emissions and suggests the revised approaches to the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions with regard to the production-based and consumption-based emissions. Regarding the production-based emissions, the following approaches are proposed: (i) determination of environmental policies, which also could reveal and explain the leakage phenomenon, and the channels of EKC, i.e. (ii) scale, (iii) composition, (iv) technical and (v) globalization effects. The influence of income inequality on consumption-based emissions can be explained by applying two approaches, namely (i) inequality determined changes in working time (this approach is also related to “Veblen effect”) and (ii) individual economic behaviours of households. Therefore, the present study provides a new insight into the subject of the relationship between income inequality and pollution related to climate change. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Economic growth; Environmental Kuznets curve; Inequality; Sustainable production and consumption","Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Income; Socioeconomic Factors; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; economic growth; globalization; Kuznets curve; literature review; sustainability; economic development; human; income; pollution; socioeconomics","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, ","","","","","Ali H.S., Hassan S., Kofarmata Y.I., Dynamic impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions in Africa: new evidence from heterogeneous panel data analysis, Int J Energy Econ Policy, 6, 4, pp. 760-766, (2016); Azam M., Khan A.Q., Testing the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis: a comparative empirical study for low, lower middle, upper middle and high income countries, Renew Sustain Energ Rev, 63, pp. 556-567, (2016); Baek J., Gweisah G., Does income inequality harm the environment?

In the absence of such tax, these activities generate negative externalities, a market failure that imposes costs on others, including future generations. Developing countries have increasingly contributed to climate change, and emission mitigation policies are therefore also required in these economies. Among the priorities in their political agendas, however, are to reduce income concentration and alleviate poverty. Climate policies should therefore be implemented without interfering with such social goals. This study uses a Social Accounting Matrix for Brazil in 2005 to analyse the impact of implementing a charge per tonne of CO2e emitted on income distribution in Brazil. The results differ as much in relation to the level of the applied tax as to the means whereby the revenue thus raised is recycled in the economy. Two option paths are simulated: direct transfer to low-income families and exemption from labour taxes. As complementary results, impacts on GDP, on employment levels, and on GHG emissions are also analysed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","climate change; economics; Latin America; mitigation","Brazil; Latin America; carbon emission; climate change; economic activity; emissions trading; employment; environmental economics; environmental policy; equity; greenhouse gas; income distribution; mitigation; pollution tax; pricing policy","","","","","","","Aldy J.E., Pizer W.A., The competitiveness impacts of climate change mitigation policies, Pew Center on Global Climate Change, pp. 1-41, (2009); Alton T., Arndt C., Davies R., Hartley F., Makrelov K., Thurlow J., Ubogu D., (2012); Assuncao J., Gandour C., Rocha R., e Rocha R., Does credit affect deforestation?

It highlights the growing need for international policy coordination and cooperation in a number of areas. For example, global growth is likely to slow and become increasingly dependent on the diffusion of knowledge and technology, while the economic costs of environmental damages will mount. The rising economic importance of knowledge will tend to raise returns to skills, likely leading to further increases in earning inequalities within countries. While increases in pre-tax earnings do not automatically transform into rising income inequality, the ability of governments to cushion this impact may be limited, as rising trade integration and consequent rising mobility of tax bases combined with substantial fiscal pressures may hamper such efforts. The paper discusses to what extent national structural policies and heightened international cooperation can address these and other interlinked challenges over the coming 50 years.","Climate change; Co-ordination; Environmental damages; Fiscal consolidation; Global economy; Growth; Immigration; Income distribution; Inequality; Interdependence; Projections; Structural reforms; Technological change; Tertiary education","","","","","","","","Aghion P., Griffith R., Competition and growth, Zeuthen Lectures, (2005); Aghion P., Bloom N., Blundell R., Griffith R., Howitt P., Competition and innovation: An inverted-u relationship, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120, 2, pp. 701-728, (2005); Ahrend R., Goujard A., International capital mobility and financial fragility - Part 3.

Forest carbon sink is an important ecosystem to sequestrate carbon for mitigating climate change which is a supplementary measure in addition to the strategies of energy saving and emission reduction. The role of institutional freedom playing in forest protection and which path to achieve forest carbon sink development are worthy of research. The nexus between the social, economic, and the environment should be explored. This paper uses data of 139 countries to explore this problem and proposes three transfer paths assumptions of land use structure, education, and income inequality. The three hypotheses are verified by the mediating model. The three transfer paths are analyzed under different levels of economic growth by the mediating model combined with the threshold model. The results show that the role of education as a transfer path is very clear and income inequality can promote the increase of forest carbon sinks in the case of higher institutional freedom. The three path hypothesis conclusions and related policy implications are summarized by analyzing the results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Education; Forest carbon sinks; Income inequality; Institutional freedom; Mediating effect","Carbon; Climate change; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Land use; Public policy; Economic growths; Energy saving and emission reductions; Forest carbon sinks; Forest protection; Freedom of informations; Income inequality; Land-use structures; Policy implications; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; democracy; education; forest management; income distribution; article; carbon sink; economic development; education; forest; human; human experiment; land use; Forestry","","","","","Xiamen University, XMU, (0610/ZK1108)","This paper is supported by Xiamen University project: Policy and institution of clean, low carbon and sustainable energy system (Grant No. 0610/ZK1108).","Abid M., Does economic, financial and institutional developments matter for environmental quality?

However, the relationship between inequality level impact and consumption-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was scarcely analysed. Thus, the objective of the present paper was to analyse the relationship between income inequality level and consumption-based GHG emissions from 1990 to 2014 under different stages of economic development. The results revealed a large gap between consumption-based GHG emissions at different economic development stages. Economic growth contributed to the growth of consumption-based GHG emissions in all income groups, and the largest effect was observed in middle-low- and low-income countries. Higher income inequality level was associated with lower negatively influenced consumption-based emissions in high- and middle-high-income countries, confirming the marginal propensity to emit and ‘Veblen effect’ theories. Meanwhile, regarding the middle-low- and low-income groups, the relationships between inequality level and GHG emissions were insignificant. Urbanisation level contributed to the growth of consumption-based GHG emissions in middle- and low-income countries. Education level contributed to the reduction of consumption-based GHG emissions in high-, middle-high-, and middle-low-income countries, and growth of emissions in low-income countries. Therefore, our analysis revealed that income inequality and climate change are still incompatible in all income groups, and we suggested how to achieve the reduction of income inequality and climate change simultaneously. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Economic growth; Income inequality; Marginal propensity to emit; Sustainable consumption; Veblen effect","Economic Development; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Income; Socioeconomic Factors; climate change; developing world; economic development; economic growth; emission control; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; income distribution; urbanization; economic development; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; income; socioeconomics","","Greenhouse Gases, ","","","","","Baiocchi G., Minx J., Hubacek K., The impact of social factors and consumer behavior on carbon dioxide emissions in the United Kingdom, J Ind Ecol, 14, 1, pp. 50-72, (2010); Baloch A., Shah S.Z., Noor Z.M., Magsi H.B., The nexus between income inequality, economic growth and environmental degradation in Pakistan, Geochem J, 83, pp. 207-222, (2018); Barro R.J., Inequality and growth in a panel of countries, J Econ Growth, 5, 1, pp. 5-32, (2000); Berthe A., Elie L., Mechanisms explaining the impact of economic inequality on environmental deterioration, Ecol Econ, 116, pp. 191-200, (2015); Borghesi S., Income inequality and the environmental Kuznets curve, Environ Inequal Collect Action, (2006); Bowles S., Park Y., Emulation, inequality, and work hours: was Thorsten Veblen right?, Econ J, 115, 507, pp. F397-F412, (2005); Boyce J.K., Inequality as a cause of environmental degradation, Ecol Econ, 11, pp. 169-178, (1994); Casalo L.V., Escario J.-J., Heterogeneity in the association between environmental attitudes and pro-environmental behavior: a multilevel regression approach, J Clean Prod, 175, pp. 155-163, (2018); Chancel L., Hough A., Voituriez T., Reducing inequalities within countries: assessing the potential of the sustainable development goals, Glob Pol, 9, 1, pp. 5-16, (2018); Charfeddine L., Mrabet Z., The impact of economic development and social-political factors on ecological footprint: a panel data analysis for 15 MENA countries, Renew Sust Energ Rev, 76, pp. 138-154, (2017); Core Team R., R: a language and environment for statistical computing, (2017); Croissant Y., Millo G., Panel Data Econometrics in R: The Plm Package, Post-Print, HAL, (2008); Golley J., Meng X., Income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions: the case of Chinese urban households, Energy Econ, 34, 6, pp. 1864-1872, (2012); Greene W.H., Econometric analysis, (2012); Griffith R., Redding S., van Reenen J., Mapping the two faces of RandD: productivity growth in a panel of OECD industries, Rev Econ Stat, 86, 4, pp. 883-895, (2004); Grossman G.M., Krueger A.B., Economic growth and the environment, Q J Econ, 110, pp. 353-377, (1995); Grunewald N., Harteisen M., Lay J., Minx J., Renner S., The Carbon Footprint of Indian Households, pp. 5-11, (2012); Grunewald N., Klasen S., Martinez-Zarzoso I., Muris C., The trade-off between income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions, Ecol Econ, 142, pp. 249-256, (2017); Hao Y., Chen H., Zhang Q., Will income inequality affect environmental quality?

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is today one of the world’s foremost economic and financial hubs and a repository for 18% of the world’s stored wealth, home to the region’s most vibrant stock market, a major free trade port city and traditional gateway to mainland China, the world’s 2nd largest economy. The recent street protests which broke out in June 2019 have been described as a pro-democracy movement. However, other analysts disagree and argue that the street protests have more in common with the populist movements springing up in other parts of the world as the result of a growing divide between rich and poor. This book delves into financial realities, Hong Kong’s position within the new global competition between China and the United States, and as a model for the urbanization of the future. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Democratization Movement; Finance and Banking; Greater China; Hong Kong Protests; Macroeconomics","","","","","","","","Moore M., Daily Telegraph, (2012); Bielicki K.T., (2019); South China Morning Post, (2019); China’s Crisis of Success, (2019)","","","Springer Singapore","","","","","","","978-981157028-5; 978-981157027-8","","","English","Status Anxiety: Hong Kong’s Crisis of Identity","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151178257"

Each of the inequality measures, which focus on unique characteristics of income distributions, is used to evaluate the arguments of different analytical approaches. Results of the longitudinal analysis for the 1997 to 2012 period indicate that state-level emissions are positively associated with the income share of the top 10%, while the effect of the Gini coefficient on emissions is non-significant. The statistically significant relationship between CO2 emissions and the concentration of income among the top 10% is consistent with analytical approaches that focus on political economy dynamics and Veblen effects, which highlight the potential political and economic power and emulative influence of the wealthy. The null effect of the Gini coefficient is generally inconsistent with the marginal propensity to emit approach, which posits that when incomes become more equally distributed, the poor will increase their consumption of energy and other carbon-intensive products as they move into the middle class. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Climate change; Ecological economics; Environmental sociology; Income inequality; Sustainability","United States; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; consumption behavior; ecological economics; energy use; environmental economics; equity; income distribution; longitudinal gradient; political economy; socioeconomic conditions; spatial analysis; sustainability","","","","","","","Allison P., Fixed Effects Regression Models, (2008); Beck N., Katz J., What to do (and not do) with time-series cross-section data, Am.

However, migration decisions in response to climate change could have broader effects on population dynamics in affected regions. Here, I model the effect of climate change on fertility rates, income inequality, and human capital accumulation in developing countries, focusing on the instrumental role of migration as a key adaptation mechanism. In particular, I investigate how climate-induced migration in developing countries will affect those who do not migrate. I find that holding all else constant, climate change raises the return on acquiring skills, because skilled individuals have greater migration opportunities than unskilled individuals. In response to this change in incentives, parents may choose to invest more in education and have fewer children. This may ultimately reduce local income inequality, partially offsetting some of the damages of climate change for low-income individuals who do not migrate.","","climate change; climate effect; developing world; fertility; human capital; income distribution; population dynamics; population migration; socioeconomic conditions","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (703399)","","Black R., Arnell N.W., Adger W.N., Thomas D., Geddes A., Migration, immobility and displacement outcomes following extreme events, Environ.

The ISEW is a measure of economic welfare in that it measures the contribution of a country's or region's economy to the overall level of well-being of its citizens. It does so by comparing the benefits and the costs of economic activities rather than simply looking at the market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy (Gross Domestic Product-GDP). The ISEW for Flanders shows that the per capita level of sustainable economic welfare in the region decreased between 1990 and 2009. The drop in the ISEW/capita is caused by a deterioration of the net international investment position of Belgium (which is divided over the different regions in the country on a per capita basis) and by an increase in the income inequalities in Flanders. To a lesser extent, the increase of the environmental costs (climate change and the use of non-renewable energy resources) also contributed to the decrease in the ISEW per capita. In the last four years of the study period, the level of sustainable economic welfare in the Flemish region started to rise again, even in 2008 and 2009 during the economic recession. © 2013 by the authors.","Belgium; Beyond GDP; Economic welfare; Flanders; ISEW; Regional progress","Belgium; Flanders; cost-benefit analysis; Gross Domestic Product; income distribution; regional economy; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; welfare economics","","","","","","","Stiglitz J., Sen A., Fitoussi J.P., Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, (2009); Bleys B., De Index voor Duurzame Economische Welvaart (ISEW) voor Vlaanderen, 1990-2009 (in Dutch), study carried out for the Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij, MIRA, MIRA/2012/04, Hogeschool Gent.

This paper dissects two experiences of wind energy development in Crete, Greece and Oaxaca, Mexico, exploring key commonalities and differences. It demonstrates that land/green grabbing, but more specifically 'accumulation by wind energy', is taking place in both regions. The specific processes and outcomes of 'accumulation by wind energy' differ according to the socio-political and ecological context of each case. There are, however, various similarities in logics, methods and strategies facilitating accumulation by wind energy that reveal defining features and similar outcomes. Wind energy development in Crete and Oaxaca is continuing the existing trajectory of energy extraction companies, resulting in an intensification of existing income-inequality, ecological degradation and social conflict, whilst spreading coercive cultural change. Based on these cases and critical (wind park) literature, we argue, that in actuality wind energy development represents a 'Trojan horse' for capitalism's ongoing growth intensifying socio-ecological crisis through 'accumulation by wind energy'. Wind parks serve as 'Trojan horses' for, amongst others, corporate land grabbing and temporarily mediating capitalism's key contradictions. © 2019 Okanagan University College.","Climate change; Crete; Green economy; Green grabbing; Oaxaca; Wind energy","","","","","","","","In the midst of CNTE's protest, Peña Nieto inaugurates wind energy park in Oaxaca, (2016); Argenti N., Knight D.M., Sun, wind, and the rebirth of extractive economies: Renewable energy investment and metanarratives of crisis in Greece, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 21, 4, pp. 781-802, (2015); Avila S., Contesting energy transitions: wind power and conflicts in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Journal of Political Ecology, 24, pp. 992-1012, (2017); Avila S., Environmental justice and the expanding geography of wind power conflicts, Sustainability Science, pp. 1-18, (2018); Bessi R., Santiago Navarro F., Bíi Hioxo wind energy project hurting indigenous peoples and their territories, (2014); Blaser M., Notes toward a political ontology of 'environmental' conflicts, Contested Ecologies: Dialogues in the South on Nature and Knowledge, pp. 13-27, (2013); Borras S.M., Cristobal K., Sergio G., Wilkinson J., Land grabbing and global capitalist accumulation: Key features in Latin America, Canadian Journal of Development Studies, 33, pp. 402-416, (2012); Brannstrom C., Gorayeb A., Jociclea de Sousa M., Loureiro C., Antonio J., de Andrade M., da Edson V.S., Ana de L.R.F., de Rafael F.O., Is Brazilian wind power development sustainable?, Insights from a review of conflicts in Ceará state.

At the same time, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on public health and social and economic systems—including a massive depression of economic activity—has caused citizens, central banks, governments, and academics to rethink sustainable finance as something much more than climate change investment or a trendy industry term. While the outbreak of COVID-19 may itself be the product of human interference with nature, it is not the only challenge human societies face today.Racial, gender, and income inequality and the fate of liberal democracy are as important and should feature prominently in public debate and policy-makers’agendas. © 2021 by Emilios Avgouleas.","","","","","","","","","Sustainable Development Goals; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) created a financial sector partnership programme nearly 30 years ago in the aftermath of the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. This eventually zevolved into the UNEP Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). An influential UNEP FI report has noted:“Investment needs for the SDGs are huge, with the bulk in developing countries and their infrastructure.The scale of current financial flows is insufficient: private finance is constrained by risk and return requirements, while public finance is in scarce supply. If the resulting financing gap remains unresolved,investment needs will grow over time because of a cumulative effect… could business models be rethought in ways that would increase SDG serving financial flows, but also make them less risky?” U.N.ENV’T PROGRAMME FIN.

To fulfill this task, we propose a dynamic panel threshold model with cross-sectional dependence, based on a balance panel data of 92 countries over the period 1991–2015. The results suggest the presence of nonlinear effects of threshold variables, which have asymmetric impacts on the negative relationships between income inequality and carbon emissions. Further, we find that the promotion of globalization significantly contributes to reduce the effect of income unfairness improvement on the increase of carbon emissions, and this similar effect could also be achieved through shrinking income inequality per se and spurring economic growth. We therefore suggest the stakeholders keep working on pushing the reinforced trend of globalization when weighting the trade-offs between income inequality alleviation and carbon emission mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Cross-sectional dependence; Dynamic panel threshold model; Economic growth; Globalization; Income inequality","Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Development; Income; Socioeconomic Factors; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; International trade; carbon; carbon dioxide; Carbon emissions; Cross sectional dependence; Dynamic panel threshold model; Dynamic panels; Economic growths; Globalisation; Income inequality; Non-linear thresholds; Panel data; Threshold model; carbon emission; environmental economics; equity; globalization; income distribution; panel data; threshold; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; economic development; energy consumption; greenhouse effect; highest income group; income; lowest income group; cross-sectional study; economic development; income; socioeconomics; Carbon","","carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon, ; Carbon Dioxide, ","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NSSFC, (15CJY005); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NSSFC","The authors greatly acknowledge the valuable comments of editors and anonymous referees.

Most of the time, disaster recovery efforts produce net benefits to society. However, depending on their design and governance, some projects can germinate adverse social, political, and economic outcomes. Drawing from concepts in political economy, political ecology, justice theory, and critical development studies, this study first presents a conceptual typology revolving around four key processes: enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment. Enclosure refers to when disaster recovery transfers public assets into private hands or expands the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when disaster recovery limits access to resources or marginalizes particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when efforts intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when disaster recovery aggravates the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsens concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. The study then documents the presence of these four inequitable attributes across four empirical case studies: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction in the United States, recovery efforts for the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, and the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. It next offers three policy recommendations for analysts, program managers, and researchers at large: spreading risks via insurance, adhering to principles of free prior informed consent, and preventing damage through punitive environmental bonds. The political economy of disaster must be taken into account so that projects can maximize their efficacy and avoid marginalizing those most vulnerable to those very disasters. © 2018 The Author(s)","Climate change adaptation; Disaster relief; Enclosure; Exclusion; Political ecology; Political economy; Resistance","New Zealand; Philippines; Thailand; United States; adaptive management; conceptual framework; disaster management; disaster relief; governance approach; meteorological hazard; natural disaster; political economy; seismic hazard; social exclusion; vulnerability","","","","","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, MBIE; Research Councils United Kingdom, (ESRC-DFID ES/M008932/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/K011790/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; National Science Foundation, NSF, (0522133); National Science Foundation, NSF; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (ES/M008932/1); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI","The authors are appreciative to the United States National Science Foundation for Grant 0522133, the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) for Grant ESRC-DFID ES/M008932/1, and the RCUK for Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1, which have supported elements of the work reported here.

Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world's primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.

Such dividends indicate if government revenues raised from energy-related environmental taxes and recycled back to households or industries through (regional) social security contributions will yield welfare gains larger than gross cost. Building on existing double dividend theory, we broaden the scope by considering both social and regional aspects of a CETR.We explore the use of household transfers and regional payroll taxes as recycling instruments and investigate to what extent wage formation on the labor market has an effect. For Norway, our results indicate that a CETR may conflict with sub-national policy goals under all assessed scenarios. In particular, this holds for income inequality. Although our analysis concerns the social, economic and environmental aims of a Norwegian policy, the approach can be generalized to, e.g., a European context. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate and energy tax reform; Double dividend; Labor market; Regional CGE analysis","Norway; climate change; energy policy; environmental economics; general equilibrium analysis; labor market; social security; tax reform; tax system; trade-environment relations","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691843)","","Statistics Norway; Ekins P., Speck S., Competitiveness and Exemptions FromEnvironmental Taxes in Europe, Environ.

The issue of household carbon footprint inequality is relevant in mitigating climate change through curbing household emissions. This study investigates household carbon footprint inequality in the Philippines and decomposes it into consumption sources applying the standard method used in analyzing income inequality. Results show that the richest 20% of the population has an aggregate share of more than 50% in the total household emissions. Between 2000 and 2006, the Gini coefficient of carbon footprint increases from 0.455 to 0.475. This implies that there is a high and worsening carbon footprint disparity among Filipino households. This disparity in emissions is more pronounced among rich and poor households relative to the middle-income households depicting a non-monotonous kind of relationship between household income and carbon emissions. This suggests that variations in lifestyle and consumption preferences determine overall household emissions inequality. In addition, the decomposition analysis suggests that inequality in carbon footprint is mainly driven by energy-intensive consumption such as fuel, light and transportation. At any affluence level, promotion of less carbon-intensive or energy-efficient consumption allows for the reduction of not just the emissions level, but also the disparity in household carbon footprint. © 2019, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon intensive; Climate change mitigation; Gini index; Household consumption","","","","","","Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University; European Commission Erasmus; Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, GAU","Funding text 1: The author would like to acknowledge the financial support from the program Exchange by Promoting Quality Education, Research and Training in South and South-East Asia (EXPERTS 1) funded by the European Commission Erasmus and the guidance of Prof. Dr. Stephan Klasen of Göttingen University, Germany.

Many studies have shown a correlation among income, the income gap, and carbon emissions, but the influence mechanism remains unclear of income and the income gap on carbon emissions. Using the input-output method, we introduce residents’ consumption tendency to construct a mathematical model to discuss the mechanism of the influence of income and the income gap on indirect carbon emissions from household consumption (ICEH). Data at the national and provincial levels are used to conduct empirical research based on the model. Our model indicates four scenarios in which income and the income gap affect ICEH through residents’ consumption tendency. When richer urban residents have a greater consumption tendency, a decrease in the income gap would reduce carbon emissions. The empirical results show that a decrease in the income gap is correlated with an increase in ICEH in China from 2002 to 2012. Therefore, the win-win situation of “increased income and narrowed income gap-reduced carbon emissions” is hard to achieve in China. Policymakers must urgently explore other ways to reduce carbon emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Income; Indirect carbon emissions from household consumption; Residents’ consumption tendency; Urban-rural income gap","Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Humans; Income; Socioeconomic Factors; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; environmental impact; income; input-output analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; China; economic development; human; income; socioeconomics","","carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon, ; Carbon Dioxide, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71303019, 71521002, 71573015); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFA0602801); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71573015, 71303019, and 71521002) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0602801).

A recent transition, the US shale gas boom, has dramatically altered the domestic energy outlook and global markets; however, the social equity implications have not been meaningfully assessed and accounted for in public and private decision making. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a systematic approach to quantify the multi-dimensional equity state of an energy system, with a focus on the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin. We tailor variants of standard equity metrics as well as develop new empirical and analytical methods and metrics to assess spatial, temporal, income, and racial equity as it relates to air quality, climate change, and labor market impacts across the natural gas supply chain. We find moderate to high spatial inequities with respect to the distribution of production (Gini coefficient (η) = 0.93), consumption for electric power generation (η = 0.68), commercial, industrial, and residential end use (η = 0.72), job creation (η = 0.72), and air pollution-related deaths (η = 0.77), which are largely driven by geographically-fixed natural gas abundance and demand. Air quality impacts are also regressive, such that mortality risk induced by natural gas activity generally increases as income decreases; for example, mortality risk (m) (in units of premature mortality per 100 000 people) for the lowest income class (<$15 000; m = 0.22 in 2016) is higher (18%-31%) than for the highest income class (>$150 000; m = 0.27 in 2016). These risks are higher for white (m = 0.30 in 2016) than non-white (m = 0.16 in 2016) populations, which is largely a result of the demographics of rural communities within the vicinity of natural gas development. With respect to local labor market impacts within producing counties, we find marginal declines in income inequality (2.8% ± 1.0%) and poverty rates (9.9% ± 1.7%) during the boom, although household income increases for the wealthiest and decreases for the poorest. At a systems-level, there is an implied air quality-employment tradeoff of 3 (<1 to 7) job-years created per life-year lost; this tradeoff varies spatially (-1100 to 4400 life-years lost minus job-years created), wherein the job benefit outweighs the air quality costs in most producing counties whereas in all other counties the reverse is true. We also observe temporal inequities, with air quality and employment impacts following the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts are largely borne by future generations. Cross-impact elasticities (ϵ), which measure the sensitivity between different types of impacts, reveal that employment increases are sensitive to and coupled with increases in air and climate impacts (ϵ = 1.1 and ϵ = 1.3, respectively). The metrics applied here facilitate the evaluation and design of countervailing policies and systems that explicitly account for social inequities mediated through energy infrastructure, supply, and demand. For example, in future energy system transition, such equity metrics can be used to facilitate decisions related to the siting of low-carbon infrastructure such as transmission lines and wind turbines and the phase-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as to demonstrate changes in distributional tradeoffs such as the decoupling of environmental and employment effects. © 2019 The Author(s).

The Gentilly Resilience District (GRD) represents a combination of improvements and programs that seek to reduce flood risk and slow land subsidence. The GRD projects employ a variety of approaches to improve quality of life for the residents through innovative water management, recreational, landscaping and complete streets improvements. When implemented together, these approaches are intended to beautify neighborhoods, improve health, raise environmental quality and improve property values. The New Orleans NDRC Phase 2 application and Resilient New Orleans Strategy details the City’s approach and vision.

Under the climate change, population aging and accelerating mobility, increased urban density and environment degradation the residents of large cities are becoming more vulnerable to the consequences of such events. According to experts, more than 11 thousand people became victims of 2010 extreme summer temperatures in Moscow. The effects of the coronavirus epidemic are yet to be assessed, and it is important to study the socio-economic differences of Moscow districts in the context of crisis and expanding pandemic, considering the negative consequences for health and life of residents. The authors propose a natural hazard vulnerability index for Moscow districts. The index accounts for the proportion of the most susceptible part of the population, as well as the possibility of adaptation of residents. Such social strata as pensioners, disabled persons, residents of poorer areas and migrants are the most vulnerable, i.e. incapable of Self-protection or leaving a disaster area because of physical or financial restrictions. It was found that since 2010 the vulnerability of population has increased in 104 of 125 Moscow districts, as a result of increasing numbers of elderly and disabled people, and decreasing incomes in the depressed areas. Priority territories for implementing the policy of adaptation to hazardous events are in Zelenograd (Matushkino, Savelki, Staroe Kryukovo, Kryukovo, Silino), in the southeast (Nekrasovka, Veshnyaki) and the northeast (Northern Izmailovo, Metrogorodok, Golyanovo) parts of the capital The adaptability in central districts, subjected to gentrification, is increasing due to the growing proportion of wealthy citizens. As a result of the 2020 crisis, associated with the pandemic and the fall in oil prices, a decrease in household incomes could further aggravate the vulnerability of residents of the majority of Moscow districts; the most negative consequences are expected in more vulnerable areas. The results allow more precise application of natural hazards monitoring, warning and adaptation tools. For example, the above-mentioned vulnerable areas are in need of providing the timely ambulance access and raising awareness of the elderly locals and migrants. © 2020 Moskovskij Universitet.

Based on semi-structured research interviews as a conduit to a literature review, this paper shows how the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment impede the vitality of its climate change adaptation efforts. Enclosure refers to when adaptation projects transfer public assets into private hands or expand the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when adaptation projects limit access to resources or marginalize particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when adaptation projects intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when adaptation projects aggravate the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsen concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. In the case of Bangladeshi, climate change policies implemented under the country's National Adaptation Program of Action have enabled elites to capture land through public servants, the military, and even gangs carrying bamboo sticks. Exclusionary forms of adaptation planning exist at both the national and local scales. Climate protection measures have encroached upon village property, char (public) land, forests, farms, and other public commons. Most egregiously, community coping strategies for climate change have entrenched class and ethnic hierarchies ultimately trapping the poor, powerless, and displaced into a predatory patronage system that can aggravate human insecurity and intensify violent conflict. Planners and practitioners of adaptation need to become more cognizant of the potential for projects to harm others, or admit complicity in the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment, if they are ever to be eliminated. © 2017 The Author","disempowerment; displacement; dispossession; elite capture; political economy; resilience","Bangladesh; action plan; adaptive management; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; coping strategy; decision making; elite politics; empowerment; literature review; nature-society relations; policy implementation; political economy; stakeholder; vulnerability","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/K011790/1)","","Adger W.N., Benjaminsen T.A., Brown K., Svarstad H., Advancing a political ecology of global environmental discourses, Development and Change, 32, pp. 681-715, (2001); Adger W.N., Paavola J., Huq S., Toward justice in adaptation to climate change, Fairness in adaptation to climate change, pp. 1-19, (2006); Adnan S., (2010); Adnan S., Land grabs and primitive accumulation in deltaic Bangladesh: Interactions between neoliberal globalization, state interventions, power relations and peasant resistance, The Journal of Peasant Studies, 40, 1, pp. 87-128, (2013); Afroz T., Alam S., Sustainable shrimp farming in Bangladesh: A quest for an Integrated Coastal Zone Management, Ocean & Coastal Management, 71, pp. 275-283, (2013); Afroz S., Cramb R., Grunbuhel C., Ideals and institutions: Systemic reasons for the failure of a social forestry program in south-west Bangladesh, Geoforum, 77, pp. 161-173, (2016); Agrawala S., Ota T., Ahmed A.U., Smith J., van Aalst M., Development and climate change in Bangladesh: Focus on coastal flooding and the sundarbans, (2003); Ahammad R., Nandy P., Husnain P., Unlocking ecosystem based adaptation opportunities in coastal Bangladesh, Journal of Coastal Conservation, 17, 4, pp. 833-840, (2013); Ahmed A.U., Bangladesh climate change impacts and vulnerability: A synthesis, (2006); Ahmed A.U., Alam M., Development of climate change scenarios with general circulation models, Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change for Bangladesh, pp. 13-20, (2010); Alam G.M., Alam K., Mushtaq S., Clarke M.L., Clarke, Vulnerability to climatic change in riparian char and river-bank households in Bangladesh: Implication for policy, livelihoods and social development, Ecological Indicators, 72, pp. 23-32, (2017); Ali A., Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges, Journal of Water Air Soil Pollution, 92, pp. 171-179, (1996); Ali A., Climate change impacts and adaptation assessment in Bangladesh”, Climate Research, 12, pp. 109-116, (1999); Bankoff G., Rendering the world unsafe: 'Vulnerability as a western discourse’, Disasters, 25, 1, pp. 19-35, (2001); Barkat A., Ara R., Taheruddin M., Hoque S., Hoque S., Islam N., Towards a feasible land use policy of Bangladesh, (2007); Barnett J., O'Neil S., Maladaptation, Global Environmental Change, 20, 2, pp. 211-213, (2010); Barrett S., Local level climate justice?

Given the large number of goals, interactions are inevitable. We analyse the interaction between two social goals (related to SDG1 Poverty and SDG10 Inequality) and three environmental goals (related to SDG13 Carbon, SDG15 Land, and SDG6 Water). We use a trade-linked, consumption-based approach to assess interactions in 166 nations, each subdivided into four income groups. We find that pursuing social goals is, generally, associated with higher environmental impacts. However, interactions differ greatly among countries and depend on the specific goals. In both interactions, carbon experiences smaller changes than land and water. Although efforts by high- and low-income groups are needed, the rich have a greater leverage to reduce humanity's footprints. Given the importance of both social and environmental sustainability, it is crucial that quantitative interactions between SDGs be well understood so that, where needed, integrative policies can be developed. © 2018 The Authors","Climate change; Income inequality; Land degradation; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Poverty; Water scarcity","carbon; water; Article; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; highest income group; land use; lowest income group; poverty; priority journal; sustainable development","","carbon, 7440-44-0; water, 7732-18-5","","","Institute of Global Environmental Studies","This research was partially funded by a grant from the Institute of Global Environmental Studies (IGES), Japan .

We developed a new theoretical model, CLimate, Aggression, and Self-control in Humans (CLASH; van Lange, Rinderu, & Bushman, 2017b, 2017c), to understand differences within and between countries in aggression and violence in terms of differences in climate. Colder temperatures, and especially larger degrees of seasonal variation in climate, call for individuals and groups to adopt a slower life history strategy, revealed in a greater focus on the future (vs. present) and a stronger focus on self-control—variables that are known to inhibit aggression and violence. Other variables (e.g., wealth, income inequality, parasite stress) are also linked to both climate differences and to aggression and violence differences. When people think of the consequences of climate change, they rarely think of the impact on aggression and violence levels, but they should. CLASH has broad implications for the effects of climate change on intergroup conflict. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","aggression; climate; seasonal variation; self-control; temperature; time orientation; violence","","","","","","","","Ainslie G., Cold climates demand more intertemporal self-control than warm climates, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 36, pp. 481-482, (2013); Alonso-Arbiol I., de van D., Vijver F.J.R., Fernandez I., Paez D., Campos M., Carrera P., Implicit theories about interrelations of anger components in 25 countries, Emotion, 11, pp. 1-11, (2011); Anderson C.A., Bushman B.J., Human aggression, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51, (2002); Balliet D., van Lange P.A.M., Trust, punishment, and cooperation across 18 societies: A meta-analysis, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 8, pp. 363-379, (2013); Baumeister R.F., Park J., Ainsworth S.E., Individual identity and freedom of choice in the context of environmental and economic conditions, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 36, pp. 503-521, (2013); Baumeister R.F., Tierney J., Willpower: Rediscovering the greatest human strength, (2011); Bernhard H., Fischbacher U., Fehr E., Parochial altruism in humans, Nature, 442, pp. 912-915, (2006); Boniwell I., Zimbardo P.G., Balancing time perspective in pursuit of optimal functioning, Positive psychology in practice, pp. 165-174, (2004); Botchkavar E., Marshell I.H., Rocque M., Posick C., The importance of parenting in the development of self-control in boys and girls: Results from a multinational study of youth, Journal of Criminal Justice, 34, pp. 133-141, (2015); Boyd R., Richerson P., Culture and the evolution of human cooperation, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 364, pp. 3281-3288, (2009); Brislin R.W., Kim E.S., Cultural diversity in people’s understanding and use of time, Applied Social Psychology, 52, pp. 363-382, (2003); Brewer M.B., Kramer R.M., Choice behavior in social dilemmas: Effects of social identity, group size, and decision framing, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50, pp. 543-549, (1986); Burke M., Hsiang S.M., Miguel E., Climate and conflict, Annual Review of Economics, 7, pp. 577-617, (2015); Bushman B.J., Giancola P.R., Parrott D.J., Roth R.M., Failure to consider future consequences increases the effects of alcohol on aggression, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 48, pp. 591-595, (2012); Chapple C.L., Hope T.L., An analysis of the self-control and criminal versatility of gang and dating violence offenders, Violence and Victims, 17, pp. 671-690, (2003); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity theory approach, American Sociological Review, 44, pp. 588-608, (1979); De Dreu C.K.W., Greer L.L., Handgraaf M.J., Shalvi S., van Kleef G.A., Baas M., Feith S.W., The neuropeptide oxytocin regulates parochial altruism in intergroup conflict among humans, Science, 328, pp. 1408-1411, (2010); DeWall C.N., Finkel E.J., Denson T.F., Self-control inhibits aggression, Social & Personality Psychology Compass, 5, pp. 458-472, (2011); Dinesen P.T., Does generalized (dis)trust travel?

Despite its relative prosperity, Botswana also suffers from one of the highest measures of income inequality in the world, persistent poverty, and relatively high levels of food insecurity. The objective of this paper is to explore how political economy, climate change and livelihood dynamics are synergistically impacting household food security. The major finding is that the marginalization of smallholder farming in Botswana has as much or more to do with domestic, regional and international political economy as it does with climate change. As such, international efforts to support climate change adaptation in Botswana will have a limited effect on smallholder farming livelihoods and rural food security unless such efforts take account of political economic constraints. Effective support must be based on a grounded understanding of the real drivers of marginalization and food insecurity. One initiative that merits further exploration is the government's backyard gardening initiative, which could be viewed as a pro-poor climate adaptation strategy. The findings of this paper are based on semi-structured interviews with policymakers and surveys with urban, peri-urban and rural households undertaken in 2012 and 2015. © 2016 by the author.","Agriculture; Climate change; Farm labor; Food security; Gardening; Livelihoods","","","","","","","","Pachauri R.K., Meyer L.A., Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report.

We used Raleigh, NC as a case study to explore the dimensions of autonomous adaptive capacity of urban households and to create a scale and associated survey instrument to measure them. Our approach was guided by four capitals that support human livelihoods: social, human, physical, and financial. We surveyed 200 households in Raleigh, NC, and used a principal components analysis to test the scale and survey instrument. Results suggest the scale is a useful and concise tool. Three major dimensions were present among the scale items: financial capital, political awareness, and access to resources. Together, these three dimensions can be used to measure adaptive capacity among different households. These findings are supported by similar work illustrating the value of income inequality and political awareness as indicators of adaptive capacity. Our results also demonstrate that complex relationships among the livelihood capitals may confound our ability to measure financial, physical, and human capitals separately. This framework for assessing adaptive capacity of households, with further refinement and testing, may be used in urban areas to evaluate programs designed to impact resilience to climate change. © 2018 Selm, Hess, Peterson, Beck and McHale.","Adaptive capacity; Capitals; Climate change; Livelihoods; Resilience; Scale development; Urbanization; Vulnerability","","","","","","North Carolina State University's Forestry and Environmental Resources Department; National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, (BCS-0948229); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; National Science Foundation, NSF","We thank North Carolina State University's Forestry and Environmental Resources Department for providing various resources and support in executing this study.

However, the increase in the standard of living or economic growth does not actually reflect a nation’s welfare. Many a times policy makers refer GDP as a significance of national development and society welfare. GDP measures development of the nation and ignores the negative effects of economic growth on society, such as climate change and income inequality. Economists after acknowledging the limitations of GDP, expanded their measure of development so that it takes into account a society’s quality of life. A number of countries have adopted both the work, advising the government, developing an Ease of Living Index, which measures quality of life, economic ability and sustainability. The king of Bhutan propagated the concept of happiness index suggested that GNH is more important than GDP.

Farmers are considered to be the most vulnerable group because of their direct and indirect dependency on climatic factors. This study aims to understand the nature of socioeconomic impacts of climatic changes on the farmers in Malaysia. A questionnaire survey was conducted on a sample of 198 paddy farmers in the Integrated Agricultural Development Area at North-West Selangor of Malaysia in 2009. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, ordinal scale, and percentile. The study reveals that climatic changes have adverse impacts on agricultural productivity, profitability, income equality, employment, farmer's health, and government subsidy policy. The study also finds considerable unequal income distribution among farmers. The study suggests that climatic changes contribute to the widening of income inequality, because poor farmers are affected more by the adverse effects of climatic changes. The paper ends up with recommending some policy guidelines to counter adverse effects of climate change on income of paddy farmers in Malaysia.

This is particularly the case in Africa, where countries that have contributed little to global carbon emissions face harsh consequences for impending climate disruption. In Ethiopia, those consequences involve persistent droughts, shorter growing seasons, shifting rainfall patterns, reduced agricultural production, and greater food insecurity. Climate change is also expected to result in intensified income inequality within the next 35 to 60 years (Hadgu et al., 2015; Mideksa, 2010; Siraj et al., 2014) as well as increased migration of youth to Europe and the Arab World. Such slow-creeping but pervasive impacts of climate change will surely make life in the Horn of Africa harsher than ever. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","Ahmed H., Fortin J., As Trash Avalanche Toll Rises in Ethiopia, Survivors Ask Why, The New York Times, (2017); Alebel B.W., Assefa B., Hagos A., Productivity and Welfare Impact of Climate Change in Sugarcane and Cotton Producing Regions of Ethiopia., (2015); Aragie E.A., Climate Change, Growth and Poverty in Ethiopia.

However, it is projected that income levels would converge on the continent. Hitherto there is limited evidence on how climate change could affect projected income convergence, accelerating, slowing down, or even reversing this process. Here, we analyze convergence considering climate-change damages, by employing an economic model embedding the three dimensions of risks at the country-level: exposure, vulnerability and hazards. The results show (1) with historical mean climate-induced losses between 10 and 15 percent of GDP per capita growth, the majority of African economies are poorly adapted to their current climatic conditions, (2) Western and Eastern African countries are projected to be the most affected countries on the continent and (3) As a consequence of these heightened impacts on a number of countries, inequalities between countries are projected to widen in the high warming scenario compared to inequalities in the low and without warming scenarios. To mitigate the impacts of economic development and inequalities across countries, we stress (1) the importance of mitigation ambition and Africa's leadership in keeping global mean temperature increase below 1.5 °C, (2) the need to address the current adaptation deficit as soon as possible, (3) the necessity to integrate quantitatively climate risks in economic and development planning and finally (4) we advocate for the generalization of a special treatment for the most vulnerable countries to access climate-related finance. The analysis raises issues on the ability of African countries to reach their SDGs targets and the potential increasing risk of instability, migration across African countries, of decreased trade and economic cooperation opportunities as a consequence of climate change – exacerbating its negative consequences. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Climate change; Convergence; Inequality; Macroeconomics","Africa; climate change; economic development; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; income distribution; macroeconomics; sustainable development","","","","","Anthony Nyong; DIW-Berlin; Economic Growth, Development and Climate Change in Africa; Fondazione ENI Enrico Mattei; German Institute for Economic Research; Johnson Nkem; United Nations Economic Commission for Africa; United Nations Environment Programme; African Development Bank Group, AfDB; Asian Development Bank, ADB; Columbia University; United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security, UNU-EHS","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) which supported the research under the Economic Growth, Development and Climate Change in Africa project.

Because prior research has focused on why states fail to curb emissions, there is a paucity of research on why some states take a different path by committing to drastic emission reductions. This research aims to help fill that gap. First, a content analysis of 252 newspaper articles reveals that New Zealand made the first pledge and eight other states have followed. Second, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis is used to compare political and social conditions in states with carbon neutral pledges to conditions in a randomly selected group of states without such pledges. Pledge states, compared to non-pledge states, have better governance scores on world indices, an abundant presence of global environmental NGOs, and smaller populations. Pledge states also have lower levels of income inequality (measured by Gini coefficients) than non-pledge states. I argue that these conditions (effective governance, abundant NGOs, small population sizes, and egalitarian class structures) facilitate collective action, and thus enabled some states to make carbon neutral pledges. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","carbon neutral;

However, most commonly used socioeconomic and environmental indicators are either difficult to use in policy or fail to comprehensively reflect social well-being and environmental sustainability. This paper articulates the limitations of urban and regional indicator sets and macroeconomic measures like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), presents an alternative indicator, the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), and develops, improves and applies it for Northeast Ohio. We calculate the GPI for the State of Ohio, cities of Akron and Cleveland, and 17 Northeast Ohio counties for the years 1990-2005. We evaluate temporal and spatial GPI trends, including inter- (Ohio versus other comparable U.S. local GPI studies) and intra-regional (urban-suburban-rural) comparisons. From 1990 to 2005, we found that per capita GPI grew in 11 counties and the State of Ohio (growth ranging from 0.8% to 19.7%) but declined for six counties and the cities of Akron and Cleveland (declines ranging from 0.6% to 22%). Per capita GPI was greatest in suburban counties and lowest in urban areas, and was greater in Maryland and Vermont than Ohio. These trends are largely driven by gains in personal consumption versus other environmental, social, and economic costs. Important costs include income inequality, climate change, nonrenewable resource depletion, and consumer durables. The GPI is increasingly being estimated at local scales to complement existing urban indicators by providing a common monetary basis for measuring diverse costs and benefits. Finally, we report the effect of renewable portfolio standards and conversion of vacant lots for urban agriculture on the GPI through a series of scenario analyses at the county and city scales. These scenarios demonstrate how GPI can be used as a decision tool for local and regional development. In addition, local GPI measures offer opportunities to better engage the public and decision makers in discussions about economic, social, and environmental goals and policies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The timing of the turning point in China's CO 2/capita can be further estimated if an EKC relationship exists. In regression results, a natural logarithm-quadratic relationship was found between CO2/capita and GDP/capita, which supports the EKC hypothesis. However, China's CO2 emissions are still on a growing track until around 2078 in empirical analysis. More importantly, CO2 emissions will not spontaneously decrease if China continues to develop its economy without adopting instruments for mitigating climate change. China's wealth gap and China's role in international trade are discussed as two possible factors to affect EKC hypothesis. Therefore, reduction in domestic income inequality and negotiations to allocate responsibilities between China and developed countries for CO2 emissions associated with China's exports are suggested as further efforts.

If this is so, then the ways of achieving those goals are irrelevant. Are they really irrelevant? We are witnesses of excessive depletion of natural resources, climate change and a loss of biodiversity. Water, air, soil, light and noise pollution is increasing. We are also faced with the ignorance of human rights and income inequality. At the end the quality of life is worsening as well. The need of paradigm change from profitability to sustainability is self-evident. Sustainability is an integrative, holistic and long-term approach that advocates balance between economic, social and ecological dimensions of business, making companies responsible not only for monetary, short-term goals, but also for people and the planet. It is a known fact that many companies are mightier than numerous countries. But let us not forget that the reverse side of might is responsibility. Companies which choose the path of responsible business publish sustainable reports that reflect their efforts in respecting social and ecological business dimensions. Companies in Croatia accept this new understanding of business more and more. According to research results, they are aware of an increasing importance of social and ecological consequences of business, and the trend of sustainable reporting is on the rise. Top management has the most important function in implementing the sustainable company policy. Research shows that successful companies have a prominent role in pioneering the paradigm change. The aim of the paper is to raise awareness of sustainability in business, to reaffirm everlasting values such as respect of human rights and nature, to share examples from a small country, and to stimulate benchmarking and cooperation between international researchers.","Croatian companies; Economy of soul; Profit(ability); Sustainability; Sustainable reporting","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecology; Economic analysis; Economics; Information management; Noise pollution; Profitability; Regional planning; Social aspects; Water pollution; Company policies; Croatians; Ecological consequences; Economy of soul; Income inequality; Quality of life; Research results; Sustainable reporting; Sustainable development","","","","","","","Anderson S., Cavanagh J., Top 200: The Rise of Corporate Global Power, (2000); Bakan J., The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, (2005); Drucker P., Drucker on management: The five deadly business sins, The Wall Street Journal, (1993); Freeman R.E., York J.G., Stewart L., Environment, Ethics and Business, (2008); Friedman M., The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits, (1970); Friedman M., Capitalism and Freedom, (1962); Kotler Ph., Lee N., Corporate Social Responsibility: Doing the Most Good for Your Company and Your Cause, (2005); Kotler Ph., Marketing Insights from a to Z: 80 Concepts Every Manager Needs to Know, (2003); Malik F., Management, Das a und o des Handwerks, (2007); Max-Neef M., Smith P.B., Economics Unmasked: From Power and Greed to Compassion and the Common Good, (2011); Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future, (1987); Panzar J.C., Willig R.D., Sustainability analysis, economies of scope, The American Economic Review, 71, 2, pp. 268-272, (1981); Bedenik O., Et al., Kontroling Izmedu Profita i Održivog Razvoja, (2010); Osmanagic Bedenik N., Strugar I., Sustainable reporting - Evidence from Croatia, The Eurasia Business and Economics Society (EBES) Conference, (2014); Porter M.E., Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors, (1980); Rausch A., Osmanagic Bedenik N., Fafaliou I., Labas D., Porada-Rochon M., Controlling and sustainability: Empirical evidence from Europe, Zagreb International Review of Economics & Business, 16, 1, pp. 37-63, (2013); Simon H., Hidden Champions: Lessons from 500 of the World's Best Unknown Companies, (1996); Sklansky J., The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820-1920, (2002); Sprenger R.D., Trust - The Best Way to Manage, (2004); Walter E.H., Needed: Change in Business Priorities, Bank of America (Retired) - Hoover Institution, (1998); Welsh J.","N.O.

The most vulnerable to climate change are the poorest and less developed countries. Climate change represents an important challenge for EU policymakers and the transition to zerocarbon emissions will lead to greater social inclusion and convergence among EU countries. We use in this paper two-stage OLS in order to analyse the relationship between income inequality and carbon emissions in case of EU countries.. We apply our model to two groups of European Union countries, the old member states-EU15 and new member states-EU13. Our results confirm that there are important differences between the two groups regarding the relationship between climate change and income inequalities. Therefore, policies implemented at EU level are extremely important in order to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on growing inequality and poverty in EU countries. Governments must invest in new technologies, industries and innovation in order to address the complex challenge posed by mitigating climate change. © 2020 Albu Ada-Cristina et al., published by Sciendo 2020.","climate change mitigation policies; income inequality; poverty","","","","","","","","Bae J.H., Impacts of Income Inequality on CO2 Emission under Different Climate Change Mitigation Policies, Korean Economic Review Korean Economic Association, 34, pp. 187-211, (2018); Boyce J., Inequality as a Cause of Environmental Degradation, Ecological Economics, 11, pp. 169-178, (1994); Boyce J.K., Is inequality bad for the environment?, Equity and the Environment, 15, pp. 267-288, (2007); Donadelli M., Gruning P., Juppner M., Kizys R., Global Temperature R&d Expenditure and Growth, (2017); Drabo A., Impact of income inequality on health: Does environment quality matter?, Environment and Planning A, 43, 1, pp. 146-165, (2011); Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerability in Europe 2016.

Within the developed societies female’s contribution tent to be less than male’s on average, due to different social roles but also to different environmental consciousness and behaviour. E.g. women have different consumption habits (use of public transport, walking or cycling trips) and are more likely to support greenhouse gas emissions reduction policies related (support of recycling and energy efficiency initiatives). In Europe, direct and indirect energy consumption tend to be higher among male than female habitants a fact that is independent of income and age, approximately 39 % higher in Germany and 22 % higher in Sweden. Worldwide, it is declared that money paid to females is more mainly consumed on family needs, e.g. food and clothing, while money paid to males is more likely to be consumed on leisure, energy-intensive goods that cause high emissions. Thus, a greater proportion of an average man's carbon footprint is due to leisure than an average woman’s. Last but not least, women are more sensitive to extreme weather conditions, such as floods and heatwaves and more likely to experience fuel poverty due to income inequalities. At the same time, the global economic system is male dominated and while women have an increasingly significant role in the economic system that led to global warming, they are underpresented in the decision making, industries and organisations focused in the environmental (climate change, transport and energy) sector. Female often surpass the male participation in voluntary environmental campaigning actions, accounting for approximately two thirds in Europe. The average proportion of women in national ministries responsible for the environment, transport and energy, by level of authority in the EU-27 is extremely low, reaching the 25.6 % in 2012 according to data generated from the European Institute for Gender Equality. The aim of the current study is to review the current conditions in Europe and Greece and identify the gaps, if any, of women’s involvement in climate change and global warming decision making. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Burning; Europe; Mercury; Migration; Transportation","Air quality; Carbon footprint; Combustion; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leisure; Mercury (metal); Transportation; Consumption habit; Environmental campaigning; Europe; Extreme weather conditions; Global warming and climate changes; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Migration; Urban environments; Decision making","","","","","","","Bakke J.V., Moen B.E., Wieslander G., Norback D., Gender and the physical and psychosocial work environments are related to indoor air symptoms, Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 49, 6, pp. 641-650, (2007); Chen L.H., Knutsen S.F., Shavlik D., Beeson W.L., Petersen F., Ghamsary M., Et al., The association between fatal coronary heart disease and ambient particulate air pollution: Are females at greater risk?, Environmental Health Perspectives, 113, 12, pp. 1723-1729, (2005); Clougherty J.E., A growing role for gender analysis in air pollution epidemiology, Environmental Health Perspectives, 118, pp. 167-176, (2010); Druckman A., Buck I., Hayward B., Jackson T., Time, gender and carbon: A study of the carbon implications of British adults’ use of time, Ecological Economics, 84, pp. 153-163, (2012); Special Eurobarometer 376 “Women in Decision-Making positions”, (2012); Report on Equality between Women and Men 2014, (2014); Factsheet March 2015: Gender Balance on Corporate boards—Europe is Cracking the Glass Ceiling, (2015); The European environment—state and Outlook 2010 (SOER 2010), (2010); The European environment—state and Outlook 2015 (SOER 2015), (2015); Gender Equality and Climate Change, (2012); Review of the Implementation in the EU of Area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change, (2012); Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on ‘The Gender Dimension in the Europe 2020 Strategy’ (Own-Initiative Opinion) 2013/C 76/02, (2013); Resolution of 11 September 2012 on the Role of Women in the Green Economy (2012/2035(INI)), (2012); Fouillet A., Rey G., Jougla E., Frayssinet P., Bessemoulin P., Hemon D., A predictive model relating daily fluctuation in summer temperatures and mortality rates, BMC Public Health, 7, (2007); Genderste: A Policy-Driven Targeted Network Funded by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology); Gender Impact Assessment of 100 Laws and Regulations, (2013); Hallmayer J., Cleveland S., Torres A., Phillips J., Cohen B., Torigoe T., Et al., Genetic heritability and shared environmental factors among twin pairs with autism, Archives of General Psychiatry, 68, 11, pp. 1095-1102, (2011); Huisman M., Kunst A.E., Bopp M., Borgan J.K., Borrell C., Costa G., Et al., Educational inequalities in cause-specific mortality in middle-aged and older men and women in eight western European populations, Lancet, 365, 9458, pp. 493-500, (2005); Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

The tourism sector, which is largely nature based, is the second largest revenue generator to mining in Botswana. At the same time, multinational companies have a large stake in driving the industry. Naturally, there would be a high expectation for the tourism industry to play a significant role in sustainable tourism, particularly with regards to poverty reduction and community development. Multinational tourism operators have a potential to contribute immensely in this regard through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Social Investment (CSI). Hence a review of social upliftment practices by tourism multinational companies in Botswana is of paramount importance in order to inform policy accordingly. Research has proven that corporations that have a higher reputation of being socially responsible have a competitive advantage, as they contribute to sustainable tourism. Companies of all sizes, ranging from start-ups to large conglomerates, are therefore increasingly incorporating social and environmental initiatives into their strategies. While establishing and sustaining social initiatives require time, talent and resources, it is what investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders have come to demand in recent years. The sustainable tourism framework has been adopted to guide this study. Moreover, a qualitative research approach using the Content Analysis method was applied. Coding was done on the basis of a predetermined best practice reference list constructed using existing global practices customised for Botswana. The results show that a number of companies have adopted social upliftment practices ranging from partnerships with communities, investment in community projects, and investment in employee and community social welfare matters as well as contribution towards nationally defined development targets. The results further revealed that the MNC’s social upliftment practices were devoid of aspects that address community resilience to climate change, income inequalities and investments geared towards community livelihoods. Addressing these pressing issues would position the multinational companies in Botswana’s tourism sector to have a greater social impact, therefore contributing significantly towards the national sustainability agenda. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Moren T.

This study examines the effect of climate variability on the poverty and food security of rural households in three districts (Meiso, Doba and Goba-koricha) in the West Hararghe zone in Ethiopia. The study uses cross-sectional data collected from sample households in the study area with emphasis on the crop production sub-sector, which is more sensitive to climate variabilities. On average, the sampled households possessed about 6.23 TLU, 0.84 pair of oxen and 1.34 hectares of land. Based on the kilo calorie intake of household members per day, more than 80 and 64 percent of the households in Doba and Goba-koricha districts were food insecure respectively. The results also show that households’ income should increase by 63.34 and 57.86 percent respectively for Doba and Goba-koricha districts to lift smallholders out of absolute poverty. Moreover, income inequality is very wide in the two districts. Though moisture stress has the largest share, TLU and cropland owned by households also have a significant effect in determining households’ food security and poverty levels. Additionally, the study also finds out that the size of the family has a strong negative effect on both food security and the absolute poverty status of households in the study area. This covariate aggravates farm households’ problems. Hence, having a large family size and frequent moisture stress on crop production coupled with infertile and fragmented plots of land worsen food security and poverty levels of rural households in the study area. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Climate variability; Crop production; Food security; Households; Poverty","","","","","","Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete, Sida; Haramaya University","Acknowledgments The researchers are grateful to the people and organizations who helped in this study.

The climate change mitigation policies include carbon tax, emission trading, renewable portfolio standard, feed-in tariff, and renewable fuel standard. The total marginal effect of inequality on CO2 emission is divided into direct, indirect, and interaction effects. Results show that high-income inequality directly raises CO2 emission while indirectly reducing it through its impact on economic growth. Inequality weakens the effectiveness of certain climate change mitigation policies through an interaction effect between inequality and climate change mitigation policies. Whether inequality increases CO2 emission or vice versa cannot be confirmed from the empirical outcomes of total marginal effects of inequality on CO2 emission under different climate change mitigation policies. However, the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies may be diminished when high inequality exists in a country. © 2018, Korean Economic Association.

Together with private travel, domestic energy reductions are one of the few ways that households can directly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Although domestic energy costs form a minor part of average household expenditure, the unit costs for domestic electricity and natural gas vary by a factor of 4 and 5, respectively, among OECD countries, and per capita use is strongly influenced by these costs. Other influences on domestic energy use are household income, household size, residence type (apartment/flat vs. detached house), and regional climate. Numerous campaigns have been carried out in various countries to reduce household energy use. A large literature has analyzed both the results of these studies and the general psychology of pro-environmental behavior, yet the findings often seem to conflict with the national statistical data. The authors argue that the rising frequency of extreme weather events (especially heat waves, storms, and floods), together with sea level rises, is likely to be a key factors in getting both the public and policy makers to treat global climate change as a matter of urgency. Costs of domestic energy are likely to rise in the future, possibly because of carbon taxes. But such taxes will need to be supplemented by other policies that not only encourage the use of more efficient energy-consuming appliances but also unambiguously support energy and emission reductions in all sectors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Australia; Barriers to conservation; Carbon taxes; Climate extremes; Conflicting policies; Domestic energy consumption; Ecological citizenship; Electricity use; Energy conservation context; Energy costs; Energy efficiency; Energy performance rating; Environmentally friendly modes; European union (EU); Extreme weather; Fossil fuel depletion; Fossil fuel reserves; Gross national income (GNI); Household expenditure; Household income; Household size; Income inequality; Information provision; Involuntary environmentalists; Japan; Moral licensing; National statistical data; Natural gas use; Organisation for economic co-operation and development (OECD); Personal carbon trading; Pro-environmental behavior; Refrigerators; Representative concentration pathway (RCP); Smart houses; Social context; Social cost of carbon; Social marketing; Social psychology; Space heating; Structure of domestic energy costs; Unintended consequences; United kingdom; United states; Urban density; Urban heat island","Climate change; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Intelligent buildings; International cooperation; Marketing; Natural gas; Proven reserves; Refrigerators; Sea level; Space heating; Statistics; Australia; Carbon taxes; Climate extremes; Domestic energy; Domestic energy consumption; Ecological citizenship; Electricity use; Energy cost; Energy performance; Environmentally friendly modes; European union; Extreme weather; Fossil-fuel depletions; Gross national incomes; Household expenditure; Household income; Household size; Income inequality; Information provision; Involuntary environmentalists; Japan; Organisation for economic co-operation and development; Personal carbon trading; Pro-environmental behaviors; Representative concentration pathway (RCP); Social context; Social cost of carbon; Social marketings; Social psychology; Statistical datas; Unintended consequences; United kingdom; United states; Urban density; Urban heat island; Energy efficiency","","","","","","","Ackerman F., Stanton E.A., Climate risks and carbon prices: Revising the social cost of carbon, (2012); Attari S.Z., DeKay M.L., Davidson C.I., Et al., Public perceptions of energy consumption and savings, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 107, 37, pp. 16054-16059, (2010); 2009-10 household expenditure survey: Summary of results, (2012); Bohr J., Public views on the dangers and importance of climate change: Predicting climate change beliefs in the United States through income moderated by party identification, Clim Chang., (2014); Booth C., A motivational turn for environmental ethics, Ethics Environ, 14, 1, pp. 53-78, (2009); BP statistical review of world energy 2014, (2014); Cook D., How smart is your home?, Science, 335, pp. 1579-1581, (2012); Corner A., Randall A., Selling climate change?

Although human beings have shown remarkable capacity for adaptation and survival at the individual and at the community levels, the challenges we are expected to face in the centuries ahead suggest the need for concerted action at a broader scale. Population growth, climate change, social and income inequality, weapons of mass destruction, and public health failures are but a few examples of dangers that if leµ unchecked could threaten our very collective existence on the planet. Green technologies are expected to be an integral part of the antidotes to these threats. It is therefore advisable to understand not only successful patterns in the innovation and adoption of these technologies but also reasons for failure when that may have been the case. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-146650318-2; 978-143985465-5","","","English","Green Products: Perspectives on Innovation and Adoption","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136008603"

Several studies have examined global-level carbon inequality; however, such approaches have not been used on a sub-national scale. This study examines inter-provincial inequality in CO2 emissions within China using common measures of inequality (coefficient of variation, Gini Index, Theil Index) to analyze provincial-level data derived from the IPCC reference approach for the years 1997-2007. It decomposes CO2 emissions inequality into its inter-regional and intra-regional components. Patterns of per capita CO2 emissions inequality in China appear superficially similar to, though slightly lower than, per capita income inequality. However, decomposing these inequalities reveals different patterns. While inter-provincial income inequality is highly regional in character, inter-provincial CO2 emissions inequality is primarily intra-regional. While apparently similar, global patterns in CO2 emissions are not mirrored at the sub-national scale. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Climate change; Inequality","China; Climate change; China; Coefficient of variation; Gini Index; Global patterns; Income inequality; Inequality; Per capita; Per capita income; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emissions trading; environmental economics; income; Carbon dioxide","","","","","Carbon Budget and Related Issues” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, (XDA05140100/XDA05150100); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (40801232); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This project was funded by the “Strategic Priority Research Program—Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant no.

The Porterian models of industry structure and value creation have provided the cornerstones for the development of the field of strategic management. By taking a coevolutionary perspective, we argue that the field is now moving to the next coevolutionary stage in its development, to sustainable strategic management (SSM), an open-systems view of the processes of strategic management. SSM is culminative in nature, encompassing both the business policy/planning and strategic management paradigms. It, however, expands the strategic management paradigm to the realistic view of the organization and its strategic management processes as a subsystem of not only the economy, but also the larger society and ecosystem. SSM provides a theoretical framework to incorporate critical global issues such as climate change and income inequality. Although Porter and Kramer’s creating shared value (CSV) concept is a step toward SSM, it is still based on the unrealistic, neo-classical economic assumption of the economy as a closed system. The open-system view of the firm, based on the assumptions of ecological economics, provides strategic managers with conceptual models that better depict the reality of the practice of management. Current models used in most textbooks today demonstrate the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, mistaking abstract models for accurate descriptions of reality. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ecological economics; Neoclassical economics; Strategic management; Sustainability; Sustainable strategic management","","","","","","","","Adler R., Ecosystem as structure: An actionable construct for strategy, Journal of Management, 43, 1, pp. 39-58, (2017); Appleyard M., Chesbrough H., The dynamics of open strategy: From adoption to reversion, Long Range Planning, 50, 3, pp. 310-321, (2017); Barney J., Hesterly W., Strategic Management and Competitive Advantage, (2015); Bogers M., Chesbrough H., Moedas C., Open innovation: Research, practices and policies, California Management Review, 60, 2, pp. 5-16, (2018); Branderburger A., Nalebuff B., Co-Opetition, (1996); Busch T., Bauer R., Orlitzky M., Sustainable development and financial markets: Old paths and new avenues, Business and Society Review, 55, 3, pp. 303-329, (2016); Costanza R., What is ecological economics?, Ecological Economics, 1, 1, pp. 1-7, (1989); Costanza R., Daly H.E., Bartholomew J.A., Goals, agenda, and policy recommendations for ecological economics, Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability, pp. 1-20, (1991); Crane A., Palazzo G., Spence L., Matten D., Contesting the value of “creating shared value”, California Management Review, 56, 2, pp. 130-153, (2014); Daly H.E., Steady State Economics, (1977); Daly H.E., The circular flow of exchange value and the linear throughput of matter-energy: A case of misplaced concreteness, Review of Social Economy, 43, 3, pp. 279-297, (1987); Daly H.E., Farley J., Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications, (2011); Dess G., Lumpkin G., Eisner A., Strategic Management, (2014); Drayton B., Budinich V., A new alliance for global change, Harvard Business Review, pp. 56-64, (2010); Dyllick T., Hockerts K., Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability, Business Strategy and Environment, 11, pp. 130-141, (2002); Dyllick T., Muff K., Clarifying the meaning of sustainable business: Introducing a typology from business-as-usual to true business sustainability, Organization & Environment, 29, 2, pp. 156-174, (2015); Ehrlich P., Ehrlich A., Holdren J., Ecoscience, (1977); Ehrlich P.R., Raven P., Butterflies and plants: A study in coevolution, Evolution, 18, pp. 586-608, (1964); Elkington J., Cannibals with Forks, (1997); Esty D., Winston A., Green to gold: How smart companies use environmental strategy to innovate, create value, And Build Competitive Advantage, (2008); Georgescu-Roegen N., The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, (1971); Gnyawali D., Building a stronger strategic management community: Lessons from the past 40 years.

Income inequality and climate change have been highlighted as hindering the achievement of sustainable development and environmental protection globally. Though existing literature has estimated the influences of income inequality on CO2 emissions, relatively little is known about the long-run and short-run effects from a cross-national perspective. Therefore, the aim of this study is to shed light on the long-run and short-run relationships between income inequality and per capita CO2 emissions based on balanced country-level panel dataset for 78 countries from 1990 to 2017. In order to understand how a country's economic level affects the link between inequality and CO2 emissions, this study classified the sample countries into three groups: OECD countries, low-income non-OECD countries, and high-income non-OECD countries. The FMOLS and DOLS model is applied to examine the relationship between the income inequality and per capita CO2 emission, meanwhile the estimates of an ARDL model revealed the long-run and short-run effects. Our empirical results indicate that there is a long-term cointegration relationship between income inequality and per capita CO2 emissions. Higher income inequality promotes emission reductions in OECD countries and high-income non-OECD countries, while the influences are insignificant in low-income non-OECD countries in the long run. Per capita income, carbon intensity, population size and urbanization were also considered in this study. The estimates of an ARDL model indicate that whilst income inequality does not have a significant impact on CO2 emissions in the short run, per capita national income positively affects CO2 emissions, meaning that income growth will accelerate emissions. Carbon intensity positively affects CO2 emissions in the long term, indicating that increased income facilitates increased energy use and emissions, but that progress in CO2 recycling technology may ultimately reduce emissions. Neither population size nor urbanization rate exerted any obvious effects on per capita CO2 emissions. From a policy perspective, governments have an onerous task ahead of them in balancing economic efficiency and distributary justice. Lastly, we provide insights for policy makers that in order to realize the goal of emission reductions in the long run, it may be best to proceed by making reasonable national income redistribution policies and by adjusting the welfare system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ARDL regression; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Income inequality; Non-OECD countries; OECD countries; Regional difference","Carbon; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Cointegration relationship; Economic efficiency; Emission reduction; Environmental quality; Income inequality; Non-OECD countries; Per capita income; Recycling technology; Carbon dioxide","","","","","Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Modelling; Pearl River S and T Nova Program of Guangzhou, (201806010187); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (19lgzd09); Capital University of Economics and Business, CUEB, (MCR2019QN06)","This work was supported by the Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Modelling, Capital University of Economics and Business ( MCR2019QN06 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 19lgzd09 ), Guangdong Special Support Program and Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou ( 201806010187 ).","Baek J., Gweisah G., Does income inequality harm the environment?: empirical evidence from the United States, Energy Pol., 62, pp. 1434-1437, (2013); Balezentis T., Liobikiene G., Streimikiene D., Sun K., The impact of income inequality on consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions at the global level: a partially linear approach, J.

As a useful complement to traditional economic indicators, GPI's most reputed virtue is its great improvement in evaluating environmental and social costs. In this paper we estimate the GPI for all 31 provinces in mainland China from 1997 to 2016. GPI estimation is highly sensitive to income inequality, climate change damage, and depletion of non-renewables. We address contestable methodological assumptions associated with the three items which have been usually ignored in empirical studies. We use the Atkinson index in place of the Gini index as a measure of income inequality. We avoid the problematic duplicated counting of climate change damage and the unjustified cost escalation factor in depletion of non-renewables. Our results show that: first, GPI per capita has recently declined in some provinces, unveiling a threat to social welfare and sustainability; second, the “relative threshold effect”—the progress of social welfare promotion is slower than the expansion of economic scale—has been found in many provinces; third, resource consumption and environmental pollution, especially water pollution and carbon emissions, would generate substantial welfare losses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Economic growth quality; Environmental sustainability; Genuine progress indicator; Relative threshold hypothesis; Social welfare","China; assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; cost analysis; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental indicator; hypothesis testing; sustainability; sustainable development; water pollution","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71673014); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 71673014 ).

Barring the Middle East, the rest of the region is, by and large, modest in conventional energy resources. This is also a region where large sections of population suffer from income inequality and inadequate economic development. Economic growth and quality of life of a population depend heavily on per capita availability of energy/electricity, and thus there is an urgent need to increase the per capita electricity production/consumption in the region. Unlike in the past, it is the Asian region that is poised to dwarf the today's developed world in new capacity addition in the coming years. This fact alone asks for sensible choices to be made. Also, the Asian region is quite vulnerable to the effects of climate change, given the geography and population distribution. Today, governments must seriously consider the environmental impact of electricity generation, in order to help mitigate global warming and its consequences. Nuclear power, being environmentally benign, affords sustainability at the very outset. But that's not all. The other compelling reasons in favour of nuclear power are its compact nature as a source of energy and the promise of long-term energy security. Nuclear power is, therefore, inevitable for the region. Recognising this, the rapidly developing countries in the region - such as India and China - are pursuing ambitious nuclear power programmes, while several other countries in the region are also planning to embark on the nuclear power route for electricity generation. As nuclear power is inherently technology-intensive, there is a need for greater cooperation, to reach out to countries that presently do not have the technology base for starting nuclear power programmes on their own. Even in the countries with established commercial nuclear power programmes, there is a need to reach out to the people to demonstrate the merits, safety aspects and economic competitiveness of nuclear power, and also the role of nuclear power in the preservation of the environment. The imperatives of the current scenario warrant building confidence among the people regarding nuclear power through sharing of credible information on all its aspects to remove misconceptions. This paper describes the current scenario, key issues, challenges and possible ways to address them. The paper also briefly describes the Indian nuclear power programme for being the second-most aggressive player in the nuclear arena in this region, after China. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Human resources; Nuclear power; PHWR","Climate change; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power generation; Energy resources; Energy security; Environmental impact; Global warming; Nuclear energy; Personnel; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Capacity additions; Economic competitiveness; Economic development; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Environmentally benign; Income inequality; PHWR; Nuclear fuels","","","","","","","Key World Energy Statistics, (2009); Energy Outlook for Asia & Pacific, (2009); World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision; BP Statistical Review, (2009); World Energy Outlook 2007; IAEA Outlook for Nuclear Power Upto 2030; IPCC Reports; Energy Policy I.; WNA Information Briefs","S.K.

This book provides a wide range of economic evaluations of environmental and societal issues including climate change, emission problem from garbage landfills, and income inequality. The book explains that sustainability indicators and well-being measures can be effective guide for policy making and how they can strike a balance between economic, environmental, and societal interests. This book summarizes current practices and theories of economic evaluation for sustainability and provides understanding of emerging trends in this area. It also stresses the importance of environmental policies and business actions in achieving sustainable growth and puts forth why countries should take natural capital and other conventional inputs into consideration. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Shunsuke Managi.

Together, these environmental and consequent health conditions should prompt civic engagement to reduce shared risks and consequences. This chapter reports a broad scope of the health disorders from the leading global envi- ronmental causes of death, such as pollution, land degradation and land use, provid- ing an overview of key environmental and social problems and social responsibilities facing less-developed, emerging, and industrialized nations. Then moves on to dis- cuss social considerations in two areas: (1) public participation found in environ- mental impact assessments, and (2) how income inequality in the social environment and social foundation may impact government structure and capitalism. Finally, the chapter brings forth multi-government levels of environmental and public health resources in the United States to prompt civic engagement, address personal behav- ior patterns and environmental risks. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the role of individual participation towards resolving environmental conditions and their health consequences. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

However, water scarcity currently affects more than 40% of people globally and by 2030, demand for water is expected to grow by 50%. Maintaining current water usage in South Africa is anticipated to result in 17% water deficit in 2030 and this is expected to be exacerbated by climate change. Hence, this study seeks to explain factors influencing household payment for potable water utilizing the recently released South African Living Conditions Survey 2014/2015. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and probit model. Results reveals that 83% of the respondents received water from municipal water supplier while only 35% pay for water usage. The empirical result shows that socioeconomic characteristics of household head like gender, age and income positively influence payment for water while municipal water interruption for more than two days, black South Africans, keeping of livestock and involvement in agriculture negatively influence payment for water. Based on these findings, we recommend that South African water policy should address income inequality, encourage gender sensitive water management education and create awareness for prompt water tariff payment to promote sustainable water supply in South Africa. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The country experienced super typhoons, floods, and extended periods of drought recurring in most of the regions. The agricultural commodity that is severely affected by climate change is rice, which is the staple food of Filipinos. Using a computable general equilibrium model calibrated to Philippine data, the paper analyzes the effects of climate change as it affects palay productivity. The analysis looks at the impact on palay production and rice supply, prices, consumption, household income, and welfare. The paper extends the analysis by computing the income distribution and poverty effects of the productivity changes by applying a poverty microsimulation using the 2012 Family Income and Expenditure Survey. The results indicate that climate change decreases palay production in rainfed (or non-irrigated) areas, leading to higher prices, reduced rice consumption, decreased real income of households, decreased welfare, increased income inequality, and poverty. These effects however are minimized or reversed if the limits imposed by the government on rice imports are relaxed. If the government reduces the trade barriers on imported rice which is considerably cheaper than domestically produced rice, supply of rice improves which decreases prices, rice consumption increases, real household improves, welfare increases, and income inequality and poverty decrease. © 2018 by De La Salle University.","Climate change; Irrigation; Poverty; Rice","","","","","","","","Cockburn J., Trade Liberalization and Poverty in Nepal: A Computable General Equilibrium Micro Simulation Analysis [Mimeo], (2001); Cororaton C.B., Inocencio A., Tiongco M., Manalang A., Assessing the potential economic and poverty effects of the national greening program, DLSU Business & Economics Review, 26, 1, pp. 1-38, (2016); Cororaton C.B., Corong E., Philippine Agricultural and Food Policies: Implications on Poverty and Income Distribution, (2009); Cororaton C.B., Cockburn J., Trade reform and poverty—Lessons from the Philippines: A CGE-microsimulation analysis, Journal of Policy Modeling, 29, 1, pp. 141-163, (2007); Decaluwe B., Patry A., Savard L., Thorbecke E., Poverty Analysis within a General Equilibrium Framework, (2000); de Janvry A., Sadoulet E., Fargeix A., Politically feasible and equitable adjustment: Some alternatives for Ecuador, World Development, 19, 11, pp. 1577-1594, (1991); Foster J., Greer J., Thorbecke E., A class of decomposable poverty measures, Econometrica, 3, 52, pp. 761-766, (1984); Ganuza E., Barros R., Vos R., Labor market adjustment, poverty and inequality during liberalization, Economic Liberalization, Distribution and Poverty: Latin America in the 1990S, pp. 54-88, (2002); Hayami Y., Kikuchi M., Investment inducements to public infrastructure: Irrigation in the Philippines, Review of Economics and Statistics, 60, pp. 70-77, (1978); Inocencio A., Trends in Agricultural Water Resources in the Future of Philippine Agriculture: Scenarios, Policies, and Investments; World Rice Statistics Database, (2017); Kikuchi M., Maruyama A., Hayami Y., Phases of irrigation development in Asian tropics: A case study of the Philippines and Sri Lanka, Journal of Development Studies, 39, 5, pp. 109-138, (2003); Statistics, (2016); Statistics.

The findings suggest that higher income inequality increases US carbon emissions in the short term, whereas it promotes carbon reduction in the long term. Furthermore, we find that the absolute values for the coefficients on income inequality in the states from the 70th to the 90th quantiles are larger than those from the 10th to the 40th quantiles. This indicates that income inequality reduces more carbon emissions in states with higher per capita carbon emissions. The results provide important insights for policy makers to improve the quality of economic development and address climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Income inequality; Panel ARDL model; Quantile regression","Climate change; Emission control; Regression analysis; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Economic development; Emission distribution; Income inequality; Long-term impacts; Panel ARDL; Quantile regression; Carbon","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71420107027, 71673083); China Scholarship Council, CSC","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71420107027 and 71673083 ).

Under the proposed REDD+ framework, financial incentives are provided, primarily to developing countries, for forest conservation to reduce carbon emissions. Projects labelled as REDD are being implemented in a wide variety of settings in different countries. Developing an effective benefit-distribution mechanism between implementing agencies and local communities is a key challenge for the implementation of REDD+. We examined whether the REDD+ payment mechanism adopted in a REDD+ pilot project in Nepal is beneficial to the local forest users. We estimated economic contribution of the REDD+ payments to the total household income, calculated the role of payment in reducing income inequality at the household level and examined socio-economic heterogeneity represented by wealth and ethnicity among the payment recipient households. REDD+ payment provided economic benefits to the poorest households but the economic contribution of the payment to the household economy is very nominal and is insufficient to invest in livelihood enhancement activities. REDD+ payment to some extent helps to reduce income inequality among the households. Social heterogeneity of a household overshadowed household wealth status during the payment distribution among the sampled households creating social tension. Therefore, either alternative payment models or investment in community projects might yield better outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Community forestry; Household economy; Inequality; Nepal; REDD+","Nepal; carbon emission; climate change; community forestry; developing world; emission control; forest management; household income; income distribution; rural economy","","","","","Nancy Goranson Endowment Fund; Oracle Funds from the University of Massachusetts Boston","This study is supported by Nancy Goranson Endowment Fund , Doctoral Dissertation Research Grant , and Oracle Funds from the University of Massachusetts Boston and the Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation (RSG), UK .

However, income inequalities imply that not all households can afford flood insurance. The uptake of flood insurance in voluntary markets may decline when flood risk increases as a result of climate change. This increase in flood risk may cause substantially higher risk-based insurance premiums, reduce the willingness to purchase flood insurance, and worsen problems with the unaffordability of coverage for low-income households. A socio-economic tipping-point can occur when the functioning of a formal flood insurance system is hampered by diminishing demand for coverage. In this study, we examine whether such a tipping-point can occur in Europe for current flood insurance systems under different trends in future flood risk caused by climate and socio-economic change. This analysis gives insights into regional inequalities concerning the ability to continue to use flood insurance as an instrument to adapt to changing flood risk. For this study, we adapt the “Dynamic Integrated Flood and Insurance” (DIFI) model by integrating new flood risk simulations in the model that enable examining impacts from various scenarios of climate and socio-economic change on flood insurance premiums and consumer demand. Our results show rising unaffordability and declining demand for flood insurance across scenarios towards 2080. Under a high climate change scenario, simulations show the occurrence of a socio-economic tipping-point in several regions, where insurance uptake almost disappears. A tipping-point and related inequalities in the ability to use flood insurance as an adaptation instrument can be mitigated by introducing reforms of flood insurance arrangements. © 2020 by the authors.

Populations living in cities are likely to be particularly at risk, but the role of urban characteristics in modifying the direct effects of temperature on health is still unclear. In this contribution, we used a multi-country dataset to study effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships by a range of city-specific indicators. Methods: We collected ambient temperature and mortality daily time-series data for 340 cities in 22 countries, in periods between 1985 and 2014. Standardized measures of demographic, socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental indicators were derived from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Regional and Metropolitan Database. We used distributed lag non-linear and multivariate meta-regression models to estimate fractions of mortality attributable to heat and cold (AF%) in each city, and to evaluate the effect modification of each indicator across cities. Results: Heat- and cold-related deaths amounted to 0.54% (95% confidence interval: 0.49 to 0.58%) and 6.05% (5.59 to 6.36%) of total deaths, respectively. Several city indicators modify the effect of heat, with a higher mortality impact associated with increases in population density, fine particles (PM2.5), gross domestic product (GDP) and Gini index (a measure of income inequality), whereas higher levels of green spaces were linked with a decreased effect of heat. Conclusions: This represents the largest study to date assessing the effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships. Evidence from this study can inform public-health interventions and urban planning under various climate-change and urban-development scenarios. © 2019 The Author(s).","cities; climate; epidemiology; heat; mortality; Temperature","Body Temperature; Built Environment; Cities; Cold Temperature; Environment; Hot Temperature; Humans; Mortality; Plants; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; climate; data set; database; epidemiology; heating; mortality; OECD; temperature effect; urban planning; vulnerability; article; city planning; climate change; cold stress; controlled study; death; environmental temperature; gross national product; heat; mortality; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; population density; public health; time series analysis; adverse event; body temperature; city; cold; environment; epidemiology; heat; human; mortality; plant; risk factor; socioeconomics","","","","","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; National Health Research Institutes of Taiwan, (NHRI-EM-106-SP03); Ministry of Education of Spain, (PRX17/00705); Research Council for Health, Academy of Finland, (266314); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (19H03900); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, Yale University, PMC, (83587101); Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, Yale University, PMC; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (1107107, APP1107107); National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/M022625/1); Medical Research Council, MRC","This work was primarily supported by the Medical Research Council\u2014UK (MR/M022625/1).

Tourism in coastal Greenland exposes the reality of climate change to visitors from the outside world, the consequences of melting ice sheets on people, nature, and the traditional way of life and could promote an alliance between the locals and visitors through honest dialogues and data collection through citizen science-based excursions. Tourism also creates an opportunity to improve and modernize local infrastructure that benefits the local population with a higher standard of living. The negative impacts of tourism rely heavily on the lack of negotiation power of the indigenous people in Greenland against the pre-established tour operators (from Denmark) and other non-Greenlandic carriers who would receive the largest economic benefits unless strong government policy protects local interests and resources. Responsible tourism and tourists are the building block of sustainable tourism. The limitations of a short tourist season and a bottleneck situation during the high season creates investment that is risky and costly. Thus, a thorough and ongoing social-economic-environmental impact assessment would be mandatory steps in harmonizing tourist expectations and local understanding of sustainable Arctic coastal tourism in Greenland. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Arctic cruise tourism; Arctic tourism; Coastal tourism; Nature-culture tourism; Responsible tourism; Skill matching job creation; Social sustainability","","","","","","","","Berkes F., Indigenous Knowledge and Resource Management Systems in the Canadian Subarctic, pp. 98-129, (2000); Bjorst L.R., En anden verden.

We analyze alternative labor supply assumptions for four contrasting scenarios. Changing skill levels and urbanization reverses a decrease in food prices and improves instead of worsens within country income inequality. It however slows the decrease in number of people with less than 2500 calories a day available, and increases the environmental impact of agriculture. With urbanization, observed net income benefits of higher food prices for the poor may no longer hold in the future. Explicitly addressing demographic change is thus key in projections guiding policymakers to address the unequal impacts of food security, combat climate change and promote sustainable food production. © 2019 The Authors","Food security; Inequality; Labor supply; Projections; Skill rate; Urbanization","","","","","","Dutch Government's Knowledge Base program; Dutch Government’s Knowledge Base program, (KB-22-001-002); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (2906 93 FOODSECURE)","Funding text 1: This research received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007–2011 under Grant Agreement n° 2906 93 FOODSECURE and the Dutch Government's Knowledge Base program (KB-22-001-002).

These hypothetical countries are described by a vector of seven attributes, including per capita income, inequality in the distribution of income, measures of the health status of the population, the health care system, and access to information. Probit models indicate that our respondents regard per capita income, inequality in the distribution of income, universal health care coverage, and high access to information as important determinants of adaptive capacity. A universal-coverage health care system and a high level of access to information are judged to be equivalent to $12,000-$14,000 in per capita income. We use the estimated coefficients and country socio-demographics to construct an index of adaptive capacity for several countries. In panel-data regressions, this index is a good predictor of mortality in climatic disasters, even after controlling for other determinants of sensitivity and exposure, and for per capita income. We conclude that our conjoint choice questions provide a novel and promising approach to eliciting expert judgments in the climate change arena. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

First, it exhibits that standard tools in the measurement of income inequality, such as the Lorenz curve and the Gini-index, can successfully be applied to the issues of inequality measurement of carbon emissions and the equity of abatement policies across countries. These tools allow policy-makers and the general public to grasp at a single glance the impact of conventional distribution rules such as equal caps or grandfathering, or more sophisticated ones, on the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions. Second, using the Samuelson rule for the optimal provision of a public good, the Pareto-optimal distribution of carbon emissions is compared with the distribution that follows if countries follow Nash-Cournot abatement strategies. It is shown that the Pareto-optimal distribution under the Samuelson rule can be approximated by the equal cap division, represented by the diagonal in the Lorenz curve diagram. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Climate change plays a role in that it tends to increase the frequency and intensity of weather-related natural disasters. Additionally, climate change may put people at risk by influencing access to water, coastal flooding, disease and hunger, and leaving them with a more degraded environment, leading, in turn, to increased vulnerability. The purpose of this paper is to present a review and synthesis of the literature and case studies addressing differential impacts of climate change-related natural disasters on a society and its economy. Developed and developing countries show different vulnerabilities to natural disasters. Even within countries, impacts vary significantly across population and economic sectors. When losses from natural disasters are large, their cumulative effect can have notable macroeconomic impacts, which feed back to further pronounce existing income inequalities and lower income levels. Impacts tend to be most pronounced for women, the young and elderly, and people of ethnic or racial minorities. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Income distribution; Macroeconomic impact; Natural disaster; Poverty; Vulnerability","climate change; environmental degradation; income distribution; macroeconomics; minority group; natural disaster; poverty; quality of life; socioeconomic impact; vulnerability","","","","","Universidad Iberoamericana Puebla; Universidad de las Américas; University of Maryland, UMD","Acknowledgements We thank Haewon Chon, Dana Coelho and Julia Miller for their contributions.

The research employs the tools that are usually applied in income distribution analysis. The methodology used here gives qualitative and quantitative information on some of the features of the inequalities across countries that are considered most relevant for the design and discussion of policies aimed at mitigating climate change. The paper studies the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP and shows that income inequality across countries has been followed by an important inequality in the distribution of emissions. This inequality has diminished mildly, although the inequality in emissions across countries ordered in the increasing value of income (inequality between rich and poor countries) has diminished less than the ""simple"" inequality in emissions. Lastly, the paper shows that the inequality in CO2 emissions is mostly explained by the inequality between groups with different per capita income level. The importance of the inequality within groups of similar per capita income is much lower and has diminished during the period, especially in the low middle income group. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Household and key informant data from two villages in Mozambique are analysed. First, we explore how changes such as increased market integration, altered systems of agricultural support, land tenure change and privatisation of agro-industries may affect factors important for response capacity, including access to local natural resources, employment opportunities, and household labour and capital. Next, we investigate how people related to the market while coping with the 2002-2003 drought. The study reveals that there had been an increase in informal trade and casual employment opportunities; however, market relations were very unfavourable and as the drought intensified, smallholders were locked into activities that barely secured economic survival and which sometimes endangered long-term response capacity. Only a few large-scale farmers had the capital and skills necessary to negotiate a good market position in urban markets, thus securing future incomes. Inequality, social sustainability, vulnerability and natural resource use are all closely linked in the savannas. Hence, both climate change adaptation policies and sustainability measures need to target vulnerability context and the social and environmental stressors shaping it. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

An Indian case study of Farmer Field Schools for Integrated Pest and Production Management (IPPM) to ensure food security and livelihood improvement is presented, to introduce discussion of the role of IPPM beyond improving agriculture productivity. Does it enable farmers to adopt practices that move food and farming systems toward a low carbon economy? Does it help mitigate the effects of climate change? Does it help small farmers reach the combined goals of sustainability and development? India is experiencing unprecedented economic growth, based primarily on service sector development, yet income inequalities are widening and the number of poor - 300-400 million living mainly in rural areas - is not decreasing as a consequence of a deepening agrarian crisis. Agriculture for marginal farmers provides the major part of their family's nutritional requirements; however, it is no longer the primary source of income, neither does it ensure food security. Climatic change effects, with higher temperatures and less rainfall, have reduced further the viability of farming in drought-prone areas. The tendency is for millions of poor farmers to leave agriculture, aspiring to join the service sector but more commonly ending up among the urban destitute. The prospect for agriculture in India is thought to lie in a mix of high science applied in favourable areas to sustain the grain, legume, and oil seed output needed for basic food security; for high value crops for the rising domestic consumer and export markets; expanded investment in market-led enterprise development and skills training in rural areas; and renewed attention to farm-based livelihoods and agro-ecosystem functioning, especially in rainfed farming. This chapter addresses livelihoods and agro-ecosystem functioning, and specifically the role of IPPM as a means for strengthening agro-ecosystem resilience in the face of environmental changes. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

This paper computes economy-wide impact of climate change and its distributional consequence with the help of a sector wise disaggregated general equilibrium model using Ethiopia as a case. The projected climate shock reduces output in the sector with the strongest forward and backward linkage to the rest of the economy and redistributes income by changing the returns to inputs owned by various agents. The results suggest that climate change will make the prospect of economic development harder in at least two ways: first, by reducing agricultural production and output in the sectors linked to the agricultural sector, which is likely to reduce Ethiopia's GDP by about 10% from its benchmark level; and second, by raising the degree of income inequality in which the Gini-coefficient increases by 20%, which is likely to further decrease economic growth and fuel poverty. Thus, climate change is expected to increase the fraction of people in poverty by reducing the size of the total pie and redistributing it more unevenly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
